  "abstract": "Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight.",

The push for long-duration, crewed missions to the moon and beyond, coupled with the emergence of commercial space tourism is redefining the risks associated with space travel. Adverse health effects due to host-microorganism interactions is acknowledged by the NASA Human Research Program, and currently this risk is accepted for short duration spaceflight. However, as flight durations increase and the population that experiences spaceflight expands beyond professional astronauts, it is of increasing importance to understand the interplay between microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, ionizing radiation, altered host-microbe interactions, etc.) and human health. Microorganisms on the International Space Station (ISS) are undergoing adaptation and host-mediated propagation throughout the environment 1 – 3 . Studies to date suggest microbes on the ISS, predominantly derived from the crew microbiome, are enriched in functions related to metal ion tolerance, dormancy, and antibiotic resistance 3 , 4 . A primary mechanism by which bacteria adapt to novel environments and stress is through genome plasticity, the ability to uptake exogenous genetic material 5 . The presence of temperate bacteriophages, or prophages, in bacterial genomes is one of the main factors that enable genome plasticity 6 . The entrance of a phage into a bacterial genome is performed through the process of lysogeny, forming a “dormant” prophage containing the entirety of the bacteriophage DNA that is not actively bactericidal, but can undergo replication into a mature virus. These prophages can remain dormant for extended periods of time, or switch into their active (lytic) state, typically after intense DNA damage. Lytic phages can become bactericidal and infect other bacterial cells, taking either their lytic or lysogenic state in their new host 7 . Prophages dramatically alter their host’s physiology. The presence of prophages can disrupt and silence bacterial genes, and they can cause chromosomal rearrangements, leading to changes in gene expression in their bacterial host. Prophages can confer host immunity to other bacteriophages, preventing lytic attack 8 . During the transition to the lytic state, prophages can copy adjacent bacterial genes, integrating them into the viral genome. This genetic material is transferred to new bacterial hosts 9 . Examples of phage transduced functions include virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, toxins, effector proteins, and regulatory proteins 8 . Prophages also affect microbial populations at the community level. The introduction of bacteriophages into soil samples significantly changed the microbial composition and diversity of the soil microbial community 10 . In aquatic environments, bacteriophage lyse 20–40% of bacterial biomass per day 11 . In mouse model studies, both temperate and lytic phages influence the host gut microbiome, with lytic phages leading to a more beneficial community, and temperate phages leading to dysbiosis 12 . The role of bacteriophage in the adaptation of bacteria to the spaceflight environment is unknown. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of microbial communities in spaceflight, with changes noted in the composition of both the gut and skin microbiomes of astronauts 13 . While other studies have noted the presence of prophages in a single bacteria species isolated from the ISS 14 , in this work we show a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and characterization of prophage that inhabit the spacecraft-built environment. Results Genome summary and sampling cadence and locations The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment consisting of 388 cubic meters of habitable space. Crew size has ranged from 3 to 10 over the 22 years of continuous habitation. Surfaces within the occupied modules have been continuously sampled and analyzed for microbial populations to understand the microbiome of the built spacecraft environment. We set out to analyze the genomes that resulted from these experiments to assess the role of bacteriophage in the spacecraft-built environment. We identified 10 bacterial strains of interest (see Methods):  Acinetobacter pittii ,  Bacillus amyloliquifaecins ,  Bacillus thuringiensis ,  Enterobacter bugandensis ,  Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ,  Micrococcus luteus ,  Paenibacillus polymyxa ,  Pseudomonas fulva ,  Staphylococcus epidermidis , and  Staphylococcus saprophyticus . These 10 species represent isolates from sampling campaigns spanning from 2006 to 2018 from eight locations within the ISS (Fig.  1 ) and a Crew Resupply Vehicle while it was docked with the ISS. Overall, 245 spaceflight genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes 15  were included in our analysis. A full table with links to genomes and data sources can be found in Supplementary data  1 .

Prophage region identification and comparison We extracted prophage regions from flight genomes for each species using PHASTER 16 , 17  and summed the prophage regions identified (categorized by PHASTER as complete, questionable, or incomplete), as these region numbers are proportional to the number of prophages that, at some point, lysogenized and entered the bacterial genome. For comparison, we obtained all terrestrial, complete genomes for these species from NCBI 18  and determined the number of prophage regions for these genomes (NCBI accessions can be found in Supplementary data  1 ). Average number of prophage regions in the flight genomes ranged from 0.75 per genome for  M. luteus  to 7 for  P. fulva  (Fig.  2 ). For  M. luteus , 3 of the 8 flight isolates had two possible incomplete prophage regions per genome, but the PHASTER results suggested they were low confidence annotations and prophage analysis by PhiSpy 19 , which employs more stringent criteria, did not identify any prophage regions. Thus,  M. luteus  was removed from further analysis. Of the nine remaining species, all had multiple incomplete prophage regions and at least one complete phage, which, in theory, could convert to a lytic phenotype. In addition, five species presented with poly-lysogeny defined as containing multiple complete prophages. There were no universal trends in the number of prophage regions in the flight genomes versus the terrestrial isolates (Fig.  2 ), with four species having significantly more prophage in flight genomes, four with more in terrestrial, and one that was insignificant (Fig.  2 , Mann–Whitney, two-sided,  p  < 0.05). Fig. 2 ISS (flight) versus terrestrial prophage counts. The median is indicated by a dashed horizontal line for each condition (flight or terrestrial) for each species. The number of genomes in the flight and terrestrial categories are indicated adjacent to each group of data. Two-tailed Mann–Whitney  p  value, for H 0  n flight  = n terrestrial , and the U-statistic and Common Language Effect Size (f) for the terrestrial condition are shown. Source data are provided as a  Source Data file . Due to the consistency in flight isolate prophage numbers for most of the species investigated (Fig.  2 ), coupled with the sampling cadence on the ISS (Supplementary data  1 ), we explored the genomic diversity between the flight isolates and the terrestrial strains. We used a pangenome approach to compare the similarity within the flight strains for each species, compared to the pangenome for all strains of the same species (all genomes in NCBI with an Assembly level at or above scaffold). We defined the core pangenome as genes present in at least 90% of the genomes, with the remaining genes defined as the accessory pangenome. We looked at two metrics for our analysis. First, we looked at the ratio in the size of the flight-strain pangenome versus the all-strain pangenome, working from the assumption that the more similar the flight strains, the larger the flight-strain core genome. Second, we took the fraction of the flight-strain core pangenome versus the total flight-strain pangenome (core plus accessory), as the smaller the accessory genome the less genetic diversity between the ISS strains. For high-confidence prophage regions (prophage calls consistent between PHASTER and PhiSpy algorithms), we removed the prophage regions from the genomes (replaced with N) to capture phage-independent genome variability. Flight strains for four of nine species ( B. amyloliquifaeciens ,  K. quasipneumoniae ,  S. epidermidis , and  S. saprophyticus ) had a core pangenome fraction of 0.90 or less (Supplementary data  1 ). The accessory pangenome of the remaining five species was 3% or less of the total pangenome, suggesting a high level of genetic similarity between the flight strains for these species. The ratio of the flight strains’ core pangenome versus the total species core pangenome was larger for all species, as expected for strains continuously sampled from the same environment. However, the magnitude of the ratio mirrored the change in the core pangenome fraction with the  K. quasipneumoniae ,  S. epidermidis , and  S. saprophyticus  flight strains having similarly sized core pangenome as the all-strain pangenome (1.06, 1.01, and 1.03, respectively).  S. epidermidis  had the most longitudinal sampling cadence with 30 separate samples taken over 12 years (Supplementary data  1 ), which correlated with the highest level of genetic diversity between flight genomes (flight versus all core ratio of 1.01 and a flight ISS core fraction of 0.54). However, there were no clear trends in the pangenome comparison versus sampling cadence for the remaining eight species. For example, the 21 flight strains for  A. pittii  were sampled across three campaigns, two of which were 3 years apart. Still, these genomes showed the highest pangenome core ratio (1.21) and a flight core versus total pangenome fraction of 0.97, with only 89 genes in the accessory pangenome.  S. saprophyticus’  29 flight genomes came from a similar sampling cadence while having the second most genetic diversity among flight strains. The full genome diversity comparison can be found in Supplementary data  1 . We then applied the pangenome approach to determine if prophages contribute to variation between flight and terrestrial strains of the same species. Again, using all genomes in NCBI with an Assembly level at or above scaffold, but not removing the high confidence prophage regions, we identified Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) functions that were significantly different ( q  value < 0.05) between the flight and terrestrial genomes. For both flight and terrestrial genomes, there were significant differences in gene clusters associated with the phage-associated COG Mobilome (Fig.  3 ). Terrestrial genomes were enriched for transposases across multiple species, including  A. pittii, B. thuringiensis, K. quasipneumoniae , and  S. epidermidis , compared to spaceflight genomes. Spaceflight genomes were enriched for Mu-like phage structural proteins in  A. pittii, E. bugandensis , and  P. fulva  and enriched for general phage structural proteins in  A. pittii, E. bugandensis, K. quasipneumoniae, P. fulva , and  S. epidermidis . Only  S. saprophyticus  contained prophages that were not significantly different between flight and terrestrial genomes. In addition,  A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaecins, B. thuringiensis, E. bugandensis , and  P. fulva  indicated unique phage-associated gene clusters in both flight and terrestrial genomes suggesting a possible divergence in prophage regions resulting from spaceflight. Fig. 3 Mobilome-associated Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) functions significantly different in either flight or terrestrial genomes [ q  value < 0.05, two-tailed Rao score test  p  value corrected for multiple testing (see Methods)]. General categories of phage genes are given different shapes, while the different species are show in different colors. Log 10 (q-values) > 18 have their values shown adjacent to their respective data point. Source data are provided as a  Source Data file . Complete prophage classification To investigate the novelty of the flight prophages, we analyzed the complete prophage regions in comparison to known phage. In total, 283 complete prophage regions were identified in the 9 bacterial species’ flight genomes and all 283 were consistent between PHASTER and PhiSpy, suggesting high confidence prophage annotations. We clustered these complete prophages into 71 bins of >90% similarity, and determined the hypothetical phage family of each cluster by NCBI nucleotide BLAST search [Megablast 20 ] of viruses in the RefSeq Genome Database 21  and the IMG Viral (VR) Database 22 . The IMG Viral database was the more comprehensive of the two with an average query identity score (nucleotide identity multiplied by alignment percentage) of 55%, compared to 28% for the RefSeq viral genomes. Of the 71 clusters, 11 were unclassified (15%) based on having a total query identity of less than 40% with any phage in the RefSeq or IMG VR Databases. Of the remaining 60 clusters, all complete prophages were found to be tailed phages of class Caudoviricetes (Supplementary data  1 ). Of these 71 intact prophage clusters, 21 could be classified as novel species and 26 as novel genera based on current suggested cutoffs of 95% query identity for species and 70% for genera 23  (Fig.  4a ). Fig. 4 Homology of complete prophage regions versus viral and genome databases. a  Query identity (nucleotide query coverage fraction × by identity fraction) for complete prophage regions in each species queried against the RefSeq and IMG viral databases. The higher value between the two databases was plotted.  b  Query identity (nucleotide query coverage fraction × by identity fraction) for complete prophage regions in each species queried against the RefSeq bacteria database. Vertical dashed lines indicate the 0.95 and 0.70 query identity cutoffs. Source data are provided as a  Source Data file . Next, we determined the homology of the complete prophage regions to bacterial genomes in the RefSeq database. As lysogenic prophage regions are incorporated into the bacterial genome, homologous regions may be present in terrestrial genomes in the bacterial database. The average query identity increased from 55% in the viral database to 80% with the bacterial database. Using the same cutoffs as above, 21 of the 71 clusters would be considered novel at the 95% query coverage cutoff and 16 would be considered novel at the 70% cutoff (Fig.  4b ). Of the nine species, only  B. thuringiensis  lacked a novel complete prophage at the 70% cutoff (hereafter: non-redundant prophage region), suggesting unique prophage-associated genomic content was broadly observed in the flight genomes (Table  1 ).

Finally, we attempted to elicit a lytic phenotype from the flight strains. Seven isolates from four different BSL1 species [ B. amyloliquifaeciens  (IIF7SC-B1 and IIF7SW-P4) , P. fulva  (F8_7S_9B) , P. polymyxa  (IIF5SW-B4 and IIF8SW-P3) , and S. saprophyticus  (F6_7S_P5 and F5_7S_P13)] were provided by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As the phage induction mechanisms have not yet been explored in these species, we subjected them to two common DNA damaging stimuli, mitomycin C and UV exposure. For all strains, log-phase cultures treated with mitomycin C (500, 100, 20, 4, and 0.8 ng mL −1 ) showed a dose-response decrease in culture viability, as measured by OD600, ~8 h post-mitomycin C addition (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). In contrast, cell viability was more variable following UV-C radiation (254 nm; 5, 25, 50, 100, 200 J m −2 ). Both  S. saprophyticus  species showed dose-dependent effect on the growth curve (b–c). This was similar to both  B. amyloliquifaeciens  isolates for the initial 12 h of growth, after which the growth curves were indistinguishable between treatments, which coincided with the formation of a biofilm (Supplementary Fig.  2d, e ). The data for  P. polymyxa  was inconclusive as this species’ biofilm growth phenotype made it difficult to standardize culture starting densities and resulted in non-uniform light attenuation during OD600 determination (Supplementary Fig.  2f, g ).  P. fulva  growth curves showed very little change in response to UV expose, which may suggest enhanced UV resistance in this ISS isolate (Supplementary Fig.  2a ). For all species with more than one isolate, the complete prophages were identical in both strains, preventing us from testing for bacteriophage infection via the soft-agar overlay method. Instead, we attempted to purify phage particles post-mitomycin C addition via filtration (0.22 µm) and precipitation (8% PEG8000, 1 M NaCl). While we were unable to recover phage particles, our attempt was cursory, and a more comprehensive exploration of phage induction in these isolates is needed. Long-read assemblies provide insight into mobile genetic elements We explored the contribution of genome assembly level on the prophage predictions by both the PHASTER and PhiSpy algorithms. From the seven isolates we sequenced two strains,  P. fulva  F8_7S_9B and  S. saprophyticus  F5_7S_P13, via Nanopore MinION.  P. fulva  was chosen as all the spaceflight strains are poly-lysogenic with a non-redundant prophage region in each strain (Cluster 52, Table  1 ).  S. saprophyticus  F5_7S_P13 is a member of Cluster 41 containing a non-redundant prophage region (Table  1 ). Assemblies for both species resulted in a single contig for the bacterial chromosome.  S. saprophyticus  F5_7S_P13 contained three plasmids of 30, 33 and 36 kb in length. For this species, all five of the short-read assembly prophage regions mapped to the long-read assembly. However, one short-read incomplete prophage region was missing in the long-read assembly PHASTER analysis, despite the entire pro",

  "methods": "Methods Flight and terrestrial genomes Candidate flight species to use in our analysis were determined from literature 42 – 44 . Isolates from the ISS were identified in the NCBI databases 18  by searching the BioSample database for “geo_loc_name=USA: International Space Station”[attr] AND “SPECIES NAME”. These hits were mapped back to the NCBI Assembly database and the flight genomes were validated and downloaded. The terrestrial genomes were downloaded from the Assembly database with the following conditions: Latest RefSeq only, Exclude anomalous and Taxonomy Check Status OK. The Assembly Level differed based on analysis with Scaffold and above used for pangenome analysis and Complete genome was used for prophage identification. The Assembly Level for all ISS flight genomes were either Scaffold or Contig. Metagenomes were downloaded from the NASA Open Science Data Repository OSD-69 (DOI: 10.26030/cary-q426) 45 . A full list of genomes, reference links and sampling locations can be found in Supplementary data  1 . Prophage identification and classification Prophage regions for both ISS and terrestrial isolates were identified with PHASTER 17 . Results were separated into complete, questionable, and incomplete prophage regions and the prophage regions in fasta format were downloaded from the PHASTER web-based server. In addition, flight and terrestrial genomes, downloaded from NCBI using E-utilities (v 1.77) in GenBank format, were also searched for prophage regions using PhiSpy [v4.2.20, 19 ] using default parameters. PhiSpy prophage regions consistent with PHASTER prophage regions were analyzed using ABRicate (v1.0.0, Seemann T, Abricate, Github  https://github.com/tseemann/abricate ) with all associated databases 46 – 53  to identify antibiotic resistance genes in prophage regions. Fasta files of the bacterial genomes without prophages were exported and used for the flight isolate genome diversity analysis. Prophage regions from ISS strains were queried against the Virulence Factor Database (accessed April 2023) 53  to identify putative virulence factors using NCBI Blast 20 .

  "discussion": "Discussion Prophages are cited to be the largest factor associated with strain variation and diversity within terrestrial bacterial species 5 , 7 , which holds in the spaceflight environment as phage-associated genes were significantly different in 8 of the 9 phage-containing species analyzed. Several spaceflight species contained genes related to the production of Mu-like phage proteins compared to their terrestrial counterparts. Mu-like phages are unique in that they randomly integrate into the host genome, increasing mutation rates and host gene disruption 26 . Increased genetic diversity via Mu-like phage induced mutation may assist in microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment and would explain the retention of these phage in flight strains. In comparison, terrestrial genomes contained transposases absent in the flight strains. Transposases are common in dense populations where there is rampant DNA sharing across a population of individuals 27 . The absence of these transposase regions may be related to the nutrient poor environment of the ISS. The presence of transposases in the terrestrial organisms may also be indicative of active mobile genetic elements, which we were unable to confirm for the spaceflight isolates. Our analysis suggested a high number of novel prophages in the flight genomes. In total, we identified 283 complete prophages making up 71 unique prophage clusters, 18 of which were hypothesized as novel, and host-related genes making up over a third of the genes present in these prophage regions. While the discovery of novel prophages is not uncommon, with viral dark matter reported to be 70–95% of human associated viromes 28 , 29 , a previous viral metagenomic study was able to classify the majority of the viruses in extreme environments 30 . Prophages are a primary mechanism of bacterial host gene transfer, to include antibiotic resistance and virulence genes 31 . We identified at least one putative antibiotic resistance or virulence host-related gene within the prophage regions of all species studied. In comparison, <12% of highly antibiotic resistant ESKAPE pathogens carry a prophage-encoded antibiotic resistance gene 32 . In addition, lysogens carrying antibiotic resistance genes have been shown to provide a fitness benefit for their host 31 , 33 . There are several reports of spaceflight-induced increases in antibiotic tolerance or increased antibiotic resistance gene clusters 14 , 25 , 34 – 36 . With our identification of confirmed antibiotic genes within prophage regions of  P. polymyxa  and  S. epidermidis , as well as the conservation of prophage regions within members of the same species, we describe one possible mechanism for this increased antibiotic tolerance. We also identified categories of genes related to host immunity, stress response, and DNA repair. The presence of prophages within a bacterial host can provide immunity to attack from other bacteriophages or phage-like pyocins by inhibiting lytic ",
