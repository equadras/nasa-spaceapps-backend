  "abstract": "SUMMARY During the repeated cycles of damage and repair in many muscle disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the muscle stem cell (MuSC) pool becomes less efficient at responding to and repairing damage. The underlying mechanism of such stem cell dysfunction is not fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the distinct early telomere shortening of diseased MuSCs in both mice and young DMD patients is associated with aberrant NF-κB activation. We find that prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects. Our studies provide evidence of a role for NF-κB in regulating stem-cell-specific telomere length, independently of cell replication, and could be a congruent mechanism that is applicable to additional tissues and/or diseases characterized by systemic chronic inflammation.",

  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION The stages of skeletal muscle regeneration are well characterized following injury, starting with necrosis of damaged muscle tissue and the infiltration of immune cells ( Frenette et al., 2000 ;  Tidball, 2005 ). Inflammatory signals both directly and indirectly lead to activation of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs; also called satellite cells), which respond to muscle damage by population expansion, followed by selective differentiation into myogenic progeny ( Chazaud et al., 2003 ;  Tidball and Wehling-Henricks, 2015 ). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal X-linked degenerative muscle disease, and it is among the most common lethally inherited disorders in children ( Emery, 2002 ). DMD is caused by mutations in the  dystrophin  gene, which codes for a cytoskeletal protein that acts as a crucial bridging protein between the sarcomere and extracellular matrix ( Hoffman et al., 1987 ). The complete or partial loss of dystrophin in muscular dystrophies impairs the ability of the muscle to contract and causes the muscle to break down. This acts as constant injury to the muscle that progressively affects the MuSC pool ( Morgan and Zammit, 2010 ;  Sacco et al., 2010 ), presumably due to an autonomous dysfunction ( Dumont et al., 2015 ). Thus, MuSC function is severely affected in DMD, and although the disease is initiated by dystrophin deficiency, it is ultimately a stem cell disease ( Dumont et al., 2015 ;  Sacco et al., 2010 ). Previous work showed that accelerated telomere shortening occurs in muscular dystrophy in both skeletal muscle and cardiomyopathy ( Mourkioti et al., 2013 ;  Sacco et al., 2010 ). Recent studies have also revealed that MuSCs derived either from dystrophic mice or young DMD patients exhibit critically shortened telomeres early on during disease progression ( Tichy et al., 2017 ). These observations suggest that modulation or maintenance of MuSC function can prevent or diminish destructive muscle processes in chronic injury conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to MuSC-specific telomere shortening are currently unknown. Here, we show that persistent activation of nuclear factor kb (NF-κB) leads to telomere shortening in MuSCs under chronic injury conditions, and it is independent of proliferation. Instead, this mechanism involves Ku80 dysregulation and increased DNA damage, specifically on telomeres, that results in MuSC loss and, subsequently, skeletal muscle regenerative failure. Overall, our findings propose a previously unrecognized role of NF-κB in regulating MuSC dysfunction by affecting telomeres, a key event during the progression of DMD. RESULTS NF-κB is dysregulated in dystrophic MuSCs To understand the mechanisms that affect telomere length and function in diseased MuSCs, we assayed their internal signaling pathways by flow cytometry (Table S1). We found that a higher proportion of the MuSCs from dystrophic mice exhibited higher NF-κB activation ( Figure 1A ) and accumulation of p-p65 ( Figures 1B  and  1C ). We expanded upon these observations by assessing the timing of NF-κB activation following a single intramuscular injury. Muscle injury rapidly increases NF-κB activation in MuSCs ( Figure 1D ). But in dystrophic mice, p-p65+ MuSCs are more numerous at all time points, including baseline conditions ( Figure 1D ). Hence, the inherent endogenous injuries observed in dystrophic mice induce a constant elevated NF-κB signaling response in MuSCs. MuSC-specific NF-κB activation does not alter muscles in non-injured conditions To examine the  in vivo  impact of persistent NF-κB activation in regulating telomere length in MuSCs during chronic injury, we generated a mouse that allows expression of a constitutively active (CA) form of the  IKK2  gene ( Calado et al., 2010 ) specifically in MuSCs (Pax7 ERT2Cre /IKK2CA or IKK2CA MuSC ) ( Figure S1A ). To generate mice in which NF-κB signaling is abrogated in MuSCs, we crossed mice carrying a floxed allele of the NF-κB regulator  NEMO  ( Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2000 ) with the same Pax7 ERT2Cre  mice ( Murphy et al., 2011 ) to generate NEMO knockout (NEMOKO MuSC ) mice. Characterization of these mice demonstrates that we obtained >90% Cre recombination efficiency after seven daily intraperitoneal tamoxifen injections, which resulted in significant upregulation of the IKK2 gene in IKK2CA MuSC  mice and downregulation in NEMOKO MuSC  mice ( Figure S1B ). The above genetic approaches allow for CA or inactivation of p65 in MuSCs, as shown by flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 2A ). Enforced expression of activated IKK2 alone or ablation of NEMO in MuSCs had no effect on muscle morphology ( Figure S1C ), muscle size ( Figure S1D ), function ( Figure S1E ), and/or telomere length ( Figure S1F ) under steady-state conditions. These data suggest that in the absence of injury, persistent activation of MuSC-specific NF-κB has minimal effects in skeletal muscles. Rapid telomere shortening in injured MuSCs with persistent NF-κB To investigate the importance of injury in NF-κB-dependent telomere length regulation and to mimic the rounds of degeneration/regeneration occurring in the dystrophic condition ( Morgan and Zammit, 2010 ), we implemented a multiple injury model in control, IKK2CA MuSC , and NEMOKO MuSC  mice ( Figure 2B ). Assessment of telomere lengths of MuSCs isolated from these mice by MuQ-FISH (fluorescence  in situ  hybridization) ( Tichy et al., 2017 ) uncovered a propensity of telomere shortening in IKK2CA MuSC -derived MuSCs ( Figure 2C ). However, NEMOKO MuSC  MuSCs have unaltered telomere lengths even after many injuries ( Figure 2C ), demonstrating that NF-kB inhibition maintains telomere length. These findings further suggest that NF-κB activation is required for telomere shortening in injured muscles, providing strong support that prolonged NF-κB activation drives telomere shortening under chronic injuries. Interestingly, telomeres start to shorten after three injuries in IKK2CA MuSC  cells, but this reduction becomes more severe with an increasing number of injuries ( Figures 2D – 2F  and  S2A ). Moreover, the progressive telomere shortening observed after an increased number of injuries correlates well with the worsening histology ( Figures 2G – 2I ) and fibrosis ( Figures S2B  and  S2C ) in IKK2CA MuSC  muscles with an increased number of injuries. These studies support the notion that NF-κB-dependent telomere shortening contributes to the histopathology in skeletal muscles under repetitive injuries. Altogether, these data demonstrate an unconventional role for unrestrained NF-κB signaling in MuSCs to promote telomere attrition and impairment of regeneration under chronic injury conditions. Telomere shortening in MuSCs is not caused by enhanced proliferation In proliferative cells, DNA polymerases fail to completely replicate telomeres following each cell division, which eventually leads to critical telomere shortening ( Lee et al., 1998 ). To address whether the rapid MuSC-specific telomere shortening observed in injured IKK2CA MuSC  mice was caused by MuSC proliferative changes, we injured control or IKK2CA MuSC  mice repeatedly. At 3 days after the last injury, a timepoint considered the peak of MuSC proliferation ( Morgan and Zammit, 2010 ), mice were pulsed  in vivo  with the nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) to label cells undergoing DNA replication ( Figure 3A ). In uninjured muscles, only a small portion of MuSCs was EdU +  ( Figures 3B  and  3C ), consistent with the notion that adult MuSCs with higher NF-kB activation are largely quiescent under steady-state conditions. Interestingly, upon injury, both control and IKK2CA MuSC  MuSCs were proliferating at comparable rates ( Figures 3B  and  3C ). Similarly, an equivalent level of the proliferation marker Ki67, in combination with the stem cell marker Pax7 was found in injured control and IKK2CA MuSC  muscles ( Figures 3D  and  3E ). To ensure that the window of optimal  in vivo  proliferation was not missed by our previous assessments, as well as to confirm a large enough window of EdU incorporation was included, EdU was administered daily, for a total of three times, and MuSCs were harvested 3 or 5 days after the last injury ( Figure 3F ). Similar to the previous data, no significant increases in proliferation were evident in IKK2CA MuSC  MuSCs ( Figure 3G ). We conclude that in contrast to other cell types ( Sasaki et al., 2006 ), the constant activation of NF-κB in MuSCs does not result in higher rates of proliferation even under injury conditions. Altogether, these data unequivocally demonstrate a proliferation-independent mechanism of NF-κB to drive MuSC-specific telomere shortening. NF-κB regulates Ku80 expression in MuSCs in chronic muscle injuries Telomeres are not naked DNA but are instead associated with six proteins, called shelterins (TIN2, TPP1, POT1, RAP1, TRF1, and TRF2) ( de Lange, 2005 ;  Hsu et al., 1999 ), together with the DNA-binding proteins Kus ( de Lange, 2005 ;  Hsu et al., 1999 ) ( Figure S4A ). To delineate alternative mechanisms to rationalize the observed telomere shortening in IKK2CA MuSC  MuSCs experiencing chronic injuries, we carried out  in-silico  analysis on promoters of genes, whose proteins are known to reside at telomeres. Given that Kus bind to telomeres, aid the localization of other shelterins, and regulate telomere length, we included them in our  in-silico  analysis ( de Lange, 2005 ;  Hsu et al., 1999 ). NF-κB functions by binding to promoter and enhancer regions containing kB sites to regulate gene expression ( Dong et al., 2008 ;  Hayden and Ghosh, 2004 ). We found that proteins bound to telomeric DNA contain kB sites in their promoters (Table S2), raising the intriguing possibility that NF-κB-dependent regulation of telomere binding proteins may have a significant impact on telomere length in MuSCs. We then performed qRT-PCR to validate the  in-silico  analysis and detected downregulation of telomeric XRCC5/Ku80 gene expression in MuSCs from injured muscles ( Figure 4A ), while all other telomeric genes had no significant differences ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, we found downregulation of Ku80 protein in MuSCs from IKK2CA MuSC  muscles after 3× injury ( Figures 4B  and  4C ), further demonstrating the NF-κB-dependent regulation of Ku80. In addition, we found undetectable  tert  levels in wild-type (WT) or IKK2CA MuSC  MuSCs either in steady-state or upon injury conditions ( Figure S3B ). Since tert transcripts are detectable in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) within the same reaction (technical control), our data suggest that  tert  is either present at very low (undetectable) levels or expressed transiently in freshly isolated MuSCs, in contrast to what is known for cancer cell lines ( Yin et al., 2000 ;  Zuo et al., 2011 ). Importantly, Ku80 levels are unchanged in both IKK2CA uninjured MuSCs ( Figure S3C ; NF-κB activation alone without injury) and MuSCs from NEMOKO MuSC  injured mice ( Figure S3D ; injury combined with NF-κB inactivation in MuSCs), demonstrating that NF-κB is required during injury to alter Ku80 levels ( Figures 4B  and  4C ) and induce telomere shortening ( Figures 2C – 2F ). Overall, these data indicate a previously unrecognized requirement of NF-κB in regulating Ku80 expression associated with telomere length in freshly isolated MuSCs from injured muscles. MuSC telomere shortening leads to increased DNA damage in telomeres and stem cell exhaustion over time In mammalian cells, DNA damage, in the form of double-stranded DNA breaks, is typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) ( Mao et al., 2008 ) and depends on the activity of Ku80 to recognize damaged DNA ends ( Koike and Koike, 2008 ). Indeed, we observed a higher number of centralized nuclei in regenerating IKK2CA MuSC  fibers that positively stained for the DNA damage marker 53BP1 ( Figures S3E  and  S3F ). Extensive telomere shortening can be recognized by DNA damage sensors as free DNA ends ( Hsu et al., 2000 ). In fact, we did observe increased numbers of telomere-induced foci (TIFs) in chronically injured IKK2CA MuSC  MuSCs ( Figures 4D  and  4E ), as identified by the stem cell marker, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) ( Figure S3G ). These data are in agreement with the notion that telomere dysfunction is governed by proteins that also control DNA damage response ( Takai et al., 2003 ). To further investigate the  in vivo  consequence of the early telomere shortening in MuSCs in chronic injury, we crossed the MuSC-specific IKK2CA MuSC  mice with Pax7EGFP reporter mice, which express EGFP under the control of the Pax7 promoter ( Tichy et al., 2018 ). The Pax7EGFP/IKK2CA MuSC  mouse allows for direct visualization and evaluation of MuSCs in their native environment on all fibers within the same animal in a spatiotemporal manner. Utilizing this method, we assessed the number of MuSCs by two-photon microscopy following chronic injury and recovery. We found that the number of MuSCs decreases over time in Pax7EGFP/IKK2CA MuSC  skeletal muscles ( Figure 4F ), indicative of an exhaustion of the stem cell pool under chronic injury. MuSC-specific NF-κB activation exacerbates the dystrophic muscle defects To explore whether MuSC-specific activation of NF-κB could exacerbate the progression of dystrophy, we crossed IKK 2CA MuSC  mice with a dystrophin mutant mouse ( Im et al., 1996 ). The resulting double mutants are designated herein as mdx/IKK2CA MuSC . These mice have higher muscle damage, shown by the levels of creatine kinase ( Figure 5A ), an established damage diagnostic indicator in DMD ( Zatz et al., 1991 ). The severity of muscle defects in mdx/IKK2CA MuSC  mice is consistent with reduced muscle weight ( Figures S4A  and  S4B ), worse muscle morphology ( Figure S4C ), and reduced area of fibers with centralized nuclei ( Figure S4D ). Interestingly, we observed substantial kyphosis ( Figure 5B ), a classical clinical manifestation of DMD due to weakness of trunk muscles ( Oda et al., 1993 ;  Wilkins and Gibson, 1976 ) and impaired muscle performance in mdx/IKK2CA MuSC  mice compared to mdx controls ( Figures 5C  and  5D ). Importantly, MuSCs isolated from mdx/IKK2CA MuSC  mice exhibited higher levels of p65 ( Figure 5E ), demonstrated shortened telomeres ( Figures 5F  and  S4E ), exhibited increased numbers of TIFs ( Figure 5G ), and had a reduced number of MuSCs ( Figure S4F ). We conclude that the persistent activation of NF-κB in MuSCs in the context of repetitive injuries as caused by the lack of dystrophin leads to the aggravation of the mdx phenotype, imitating the human disease. Downregulation of Ku80 alone or in the context of chronic injuries reduces telomere length in MuSCs To gain more insight into the involvement of Ku80 in telomere shortening in myogenic cells, we first investigated telomere length in the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line ( Figure S5A ). Using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors targeting  XRCC5 , which encodes the Ku80 protein, we observed significant knockdown at the protein level when compared to cells transfected with empty vector ( Figure S5B ). Upon performing MuQ-FISH, we uncovered that Ku80 downregulation is sufficient to induce telomere shortening in myogenic cells with two different shRNAs ( Figures S5C  and  S5D ). These data demonstrate that downregulation of Ku80 alone is sufficient to reduce telomere length in myogenic cells. Next, we extended our findings by investigating the effect of Ku80 manipulation on telomere length  in vivo , utilizing a Ku80 heterozygous mouse line ( Zhu et al., 1996 ). We found that MuSCs derived from this mouse exhibited only ~20% reduction of Ku80 protein expression compared to Ku80 WT littermates ( Figure S5E ). Nevertheless, we still observed a reduction in telomere lengths of these Ku80 heterozygous mice after 3× injury ( Figure S5F ), suggesting that even a mild reduction of Ku80 protein is sufficient to shorten telomeres in MuSCs. To further demonstrate the involvement of Ku80 in telomere length modulation  in vivo  in more severe chronic injuries, we bred mdx mice with Ku80 +/−  mice. Interestingly, MuSCs in the mdx/Ku80 +/−  muscles have a pronounced shift toward shorter telomeres ( Figure S5G ), increased muscle damage ( Figure S5H ), and impaired muscle performance ( Figure S5I ). These data suggest that the mdx/Ku80 +/−  mice exhibit similar muscle defects as the ones seen in mdx/IKK2CA MuSC  mice ( Figure 5 ). Altogether, these results demonstrate that Ku80 is a major regulator of telomere length in myogenic cells, both  in vitro  and  in vivo , either alone or in the context of dystrophy. Ku80 dysregulation and telomere damage in human dystrophic MuSCs We next investigated whether our mouse findings recapitulate what happens in the human dystrophic condition. We found that human DMD MuSCs express significantly higher levels of p-p65 ( Figures 6A  and  6B ), and a larger portion is localized in the nucleus ( Figure 6C ), further supporting the notion of persistent elevated NF-κB signaling in dystrophic human MuSCs. Interestingly, human DMD MuSCs have significantly decreased Ku80 levels ( Figures 6D  and  6E ), as shown by immunohistochemistry analysis on human muscles from DMD patients. Furthermore, in corroboration with the mouse data, we found shortened telomeres ( Figure 6F ), higher levels of DNA damage ( Figures S6A  and  S6B ), and increased numbers of TIFs ( Figures 6G  and  6H ) in human diseased MuSCs compared to aged-matched healthy controls. Altogether, these striking human findings, which are consistent with the mouse results, provide further evidence that persistent NF-κB activation specifically in MuSCs leads to Ku80 dysregulation and predisposes these cells to premature telomere shortening and an increased number of TIFs that ultimately contribute to the severe dystrophic skeletal muscle phenotype. DISCUSSION Previous work had revealed that MuSCs progressively become dysfunctional in dystrophy, and telomere shortening is a major hallmark of the disease ( Dumont et al., 2015 ;  Sacco et al., 2010 ;  Tichy et al., 2017 ). Here, we provide evidence of the  in vivo  molecular basis for telomere shortening of stem cells under chronic injury conditions. These findings provide insights into the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of MuSC-specific telomere shortening under chronic injuries. Indications of perturbation of NF-κB signaling exist in various muscle diseases, such as muscle atrophy conditions ( Cai et al., 2004 ;  Mourkioti et al., 2006 ;  Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008 ), cancer cachexia ( He et al., 2013 ), dystrophinopathies such as Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) ( Baghdiguian et al., 1999 ), and DMD ( Acharyya et al., 2007 ;  Hammers et al., 2016 ;  Messina et al., 2011 ). In addition to its role in regulating myogenesis ( Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008 ), NF-κB is likely to modulate immune responses, muscle damage, and repair in DMD as well as in other muscle disorders. However, the survival effect of NF-κB in LGMD2A muscles, compared with its rather negative contribution in DMD, reflects the complexity of this pathway in chronic muscle diseases. Previous genetically modified animal models generated to interfere with NF-κB signaling only assessed NF-κB function regarding cancer cachexia ( He et al., 2013 ) and aging ( Oh et al., 2016 ;  Proto et al., 2017 ). By targeting the MuSC compartment in adult mice, we demonstrate that the inherent endogenous injuries observed in dystrophic mice induce a constant elevated NF-κB signaling response in MuSCs in both mdx and, most importantly, in human DMD MuSCs.

While the effects of Ku80 in NHEJ are well documented ( Fell and Schild-Poulter, 2015 ), its potential mechanistic involvement in telomere length alteration is less clear. Indeed, the absence of Ku80 has been associated with both telomere lengthening and shortening, depending on the cell line used; the organism (i.e., yeast,  Drosophila , mouse, plant); or the context (embryonic development, cancer, or aging) ( Boulton and Jackson, 1998 ;  Chai et al., 2002 ;  d’Adda di Fagagna et al., 2001 ;  Didier et al., 2012 ;  Espejel et al., 2004 ;  Gallego et al., 2003 ;  Indiviglio and Bertuch, 2009 ;  Li et al., 2007 ;  Melnikova et al., 2005 ).
