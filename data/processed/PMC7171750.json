  "abstract": "Background Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Results Streptococcus  was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were  Proteobacteria  and  Fusobacteria  which increased during flight and  Actinobacteria  which decreased during flight. At the genus level,  Catonella ,  Megasphera , and  Actinobacillus  were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with  Gracilibacteria ,  Absconditabacteria , and  Abiotrophia  and a negative correlation between  Oribacterium ,  Veillonella , and  Haemophilus . There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers. Conclusions This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions. \n Video abstract.",

  "full_text": "Introduction The World Health Organization published a surveillance strategy report in 2015 stating that worldwide, non-infectious disease (NIDs) represented 43% of global disease burden and was expected to be responsible for 60% of the disease burden and 73% of all deaths by 2020s [ 1 ]. In 2016, 80% of NID deaths were due to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, with the remaining 20% due to immune disorders, digestive issues, genitourinary disease, and oral or dental conditions [ 2 ]. The collection of bacteria and less dominant micro-organisms that inhabit our body is termed the human microbiome and plays an integral role in maintaining health. Changes in the composition of one’s microbiome may promote the development of the aforementioned NIDs, as individuals with inflammatory bowel disease [ 3 ,  4 ], asthma [ 5 ], diabetes [ 6 ], cardiovascular disease [ 7 ], colorectal cancer [ 8 ], and breast cancer [ 9 ] have different bacterial communities than healthy individuals. While it is still unclear whether these microbial differences are a consequence or a cause of disease, there is evidence in favor of the latter, as healthy animals transplanted with feces from those with obesity [ 10 ], colitis [ 11 ], or colorectal cancer [ 12 ] then go on to develop disease. The importance of the human microbiome in health promotion is just as relevant to astronauts and perhaps even more so, as medical procedures and facilities are limited during spaceflight. As of 2018, there have been 557 astronauts/cosmonauts that have flown to outer space with well-documented physiological and immunological issues, such as bone loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue, elevated cortisol levels, nausea, skin/urinary tract/upper-respiratory tract infections, and impaired innate/adaptive immunity [ 13 – 15 ]. However, data is still limited on how the human microbiome, which plays an integral role in human health, is impacted by spaceflight and whether changes in the astronaut microbiome contribute to the conditions experienced by many astronauts. Culture analyses conducted during the Skylab missions suggest that oral microbial populations may change during spaceflight, as increased counts of anaerobic bacteria from intra-oral sites were recorded in-flight compared to pre-flight samples from 18 astronauts studied [ 16 ]. The effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiome should be examined in detail as imbalances have been implicated in oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immune regulation, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [ 17 – 21 ], and thus could significantly impact the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight (i.e., manned missions to Mars). Reactivation of latent herpesviruses has been documented in astronauts for years. Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been observed during both short (10–16 days) [ 22 ] and long (60–180 days) [ 23 ] duration ISS missions with longer missions producing higher viral titers and prolonged shedding upon return to Earth (shedding for 30 days post-flight [long duration mission] vs shedding for 5 days post flight [shorter duration]) [ 23 ]. The impact of EBV shedding, for example, on crew health could be limited to the minor symptoms of infection to an increased risk of lymphoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and mononucleosis [ 24 ,  25 ]. The role of the oral microbiome in viral reactivation during spaceflight has not yet been studied, but may be a key factor in this phenomenon. Its role may be indirect, through immune modulation or directly, through bacterial-viral interactions. Studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids produced by oral bacteria induce reactivation of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and EBV, by activating viral promotors and/or causing epigenetic modifications in the inserted viral genome [ 26 – 29 ]. The aim of this study was to examine, for the first time, whether and how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and whether there is a microbiome signature that may be influential in preventing or promoting viral reactivation in humans. The data acquired from this study could help inform the NASA medical team about the role of bacterial signatures in maintaining crew health while in space. Results Eighty-nine samples from ten astronauts were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing for microbiome analysis and qPCR for viral titer measurements. The timepoints for each sample collected the viral status, and flight history are presented in Dataset S 1 . Impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome Alpha diversity of the salivary microbiome was assessed with Shannon’s diversity (measure of richness and evenness), Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic difference between the observed sequences), and community richness (number. of observed amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]). All three metrics showed that microbiome diversity and richness increased during spaceflight ( P  < 0.05) but then dropped back to pre-flight levels upon return to Earth (Fig.  1 ).\n Fig. 1 Alpha diversity of salivary microbiome. Saliva samples were collected from 10 astronauts at various time points before flying to the ISS (pre-flight), while on the ISS (Flight) and upon return to Earth (post-flight). Diversity was measured using Shannon’s diversity index (left panel) and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (right panel). Richness was measured by counting the number of unique amplicon sequence variants (ASV) within each sample (middle panel). Reads were rarified to different counts (x-axis) and the values for each rarefied read count plotted (y-axis). For all 3 metrics tested, alpha diversity was the highest in-flight, with post-flight samples decreasing to pre-flight values. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison post-hoc test (Significance threshold  P  < 0.05). Streptococcus  is the most abundant organism in the saliva, and in this dataset consisted of 58 amplicon sequence variants, making up 8% of the total. For this reason, it was of interest to examine how alpha diversity of  Streptococcus  sequences changed as a result of spaceflight. Unlike the collective microbiome, Shannon’s diversity of  Streptococcus  was lower in spaceflight samples compared to pre-flight and post-flight samples ( P  < 0.05), and while diversity did rebound after flight, it did not reach pre-flight values (Figure S 1 A). On the other hand, while pre-flight and in-flight samples did not show significant differences in richness (though the number of observed  Streptococcus  sequences did decrease slightly in-flight), there was a significant decrease in the number of streptococcal sequences in samples collected post-flight (Figure S 1 B). Beta diversity of the salivary microbiome was also compared. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the centered log ratio (clr) transformed data did not show any distinct clustering, indicating no overall microbiome differences between subjects and based on flight status (Fig.  2 ). Statistical analyses using ALDEx2 did, however, show that the relative abundances of three phyla changed over time, with  Proteobacteria  and  Fusobacteria  increasing in relative abundances during flight and  Actinobacteria  decreasing (Fig.  3 a). While post-flight samples resembled pre-flight values more so than flight values, they were either higher ( Proteobacteria  and  Fusobacteria ) or lower ( Actinobacteria ) than what was observed pre-flight. At the genus level, in more than half of the subjects tested,  Catonella ,  Megasphera , and  Actinobacillus  were absent in saliva collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight (Fig.  3 b ) . In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight (Fig.  3 b). The read counts of all genera detected and grouped by subject, and flight status is summarized as a heatmap in Figure S 2 .\n Fig. 2 Beta diversity of the salivary microbiome. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination of the salivary microbiome collected from ten astronauts collected pre-flight, in-flight (i.e., on the ISS), and post-flight. Each dot on the graph represents a sample, with the different colors representing a subject, and the different shapes representing a flight status. The closer the dots are to each other on the graph, the more similar the samples are in microbiome composition. The plots represent ASV sequences summarized, based on taxonomy, to the genus level and then clr transformed. No distinct clusters were observed, indicating no overall microbiome difference between subjects and based on flight status. The same analysis was performed at the ASV level and showed the same trends as at the genus level. The data used for analysis was clr transformed and Euclidean distances used. Fig. 3 Differential abundance of bacteria based on flight status.  a  ALDEx2 statistically analysis was performed on sequences summarized to the phylum level. Significance was based on the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected  p  value of the Wilcoxon rank test (significance threshold  P  < 0.05). Out of the nine phyla detected in saliva, three showed statistically significant differences as a result of spaceflight. The changes in their relative abundances between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight are shown with boxplots. The box in each graph signifies the 75% (upper) and 25% (lower) quartiles and thus shows the percent abundances for 50% of the samples. The black line inside the box represents the median. The bottom whisker represents the lowest datum still within the 1.5 interquartile range (IQR) of the lower quartile, with the top whisker representing the highest datum still within the 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile. Open circles are outliers.  b  In half of the subjects tested, three genera,  Catonella ,  Megasphaera , and  Actinobacillus  were not present in pre-flight samples, but were detected in samples collected during flight. In those that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased in-flight. The read counts for these three organisms in all ten subjects are shown in a heatmap. Gray indicates that no reads were detected while a gradient from green to red shows low counts and high counts, respectively While NMDS analysis of the salivary microbiome showed no differences based on flight status at the population level (Fig.  2 ), studies have shown that in some cases, population level analyses may mask microbiome differences that occur at the individual level [ 30 ]. For this reason, NMDS ordination was performed for each subject, in order to better understand the impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome. Five out of the 10 subjects clustered based on flight status with pre-flight, flight, and post-flight samples all different from each other (Fig.  4 ). It is important to note that different taxa were responsible for the differences based on flight status in these five individuals. For the other five subjects, while there was some overlap between samples collected from the different flight groups, pre-flight samples were never similar to post-flight samples.\n Fig. 4 Comparison of salivary microbiome based on flight status at the individual level. NMDS ordination, with Euclidean distances, was generated at the ASV level of centered log ratio (clr) data for each individual. Each dot on the graph represents a sample, with the different colors representing whether the sample was collected pre-flight (red), in-flight (blue), or post flight (green). The closer the dots are to each other on the graph, the more similar the samples are in microbiome composition. The subjects are labeled in the top left end corner of each box and an asterisk (*) beside the subject number indicates microbiome differences based on flight status. Differences are based on ellipses drawn around samples based on a 99% confidence interval. Samples that belong to the same flight status and in the same ellipse, and which do not overlap with other ellipses, are considered distinct groups, thereby having different microbiome profiles Association between viral reactivation and salivary microbiome The correlation between members of the salivary microbiome was examined for saliva samples that were either positive or negative for EBV or HSV-1 (as determined by qPCR). Associations between phyla changed depending on whether samples were negative or positive for virus. In saliva devoid of virus (no viral reactivation), positive correlations were present between (i)  Actinobacteria  and  Firmicutes  and (ii)  Fusobacteria  and  Proteobacteria , with an inverse relation between (i)  Gracilibacteria  and  Proteobacteria  and (ii)  Absconditabacteria  and  Proteobacteria  (Fig.  5 a). However, in saliva with viral reactivation, all bacterial correlations disappeared except for the inverse association between  Gracilibacteria  and  Proteobacteria  (Fig.  5 b).\n Fig. 5 Microbiome correlations based on viral status. 16S rRNA sequences were summarized to the phylum level, and a Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed to assess correlations between the bacterial communities in the saliva. Two separate correlation tests were performed, one with samples that were negative for either EBV or HSV-1 (as detected by qPCR) ( a ) and the second, using samples that were positive for virus (based on qPCR) ( b ). The heatmaps display the Spearman’s rho values, with red boxes indicating rho values above 0.6 (strong positive correlation) and yellow values indicating rho values less than − 0.6 (strong inverse correlation). The maroon boxes represent no correlation. All red and yellow microbiome correlations had Benjamini-Hochberg corrected  p  values of < 0.05. As observed from these heatmaps, there are more bacterial correlations in saliva that are devoid of EBV and HSV-1 compared to saliva with viral shedding To determine which genera were most discriminatory between viral negative and viral positive samples, the machine-learning algorithm random forests (RF) was applied to genus level abundance data. The out-of-bag (OOB) error rate was 24%, and the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) showed our model to be 75% accurate. Taxa that proved most discriminatory between the two groups were ordered according to mean decrease in accuracy (Fig.  6 ).  Gracilibacteria  was the most predictive followed by  Lactobacillus ,  Stomatobaculum , and  Oribacetrium . RF was also applied to  Streptococcus  sequences due to their abundance in the samples. With an OOB error rate of 19% and a LOOCV accuracy of 81%,  Streptococcus  strains were discriminatory between the cohorts with  S. mutans  being the most predictive of viral status (Fig S 3 ).\n Fig. 6 Salivary microbiome can predict viral status. Results from the random forest classifier showing the bacterial genera that are the most discriminatory between viral positive (qPCR detection of EBV or HSC-1) and viral negative samples, in descending order. OOB error rate was 24%, and LOOCV accuracy was 75%. Taxa are colored based on whether they were significantly higher in viral positive samples (red), viral negative samples (blue), or not (black) based on the Wilcoxon rank test with a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. Significance  P  < 0.05 Correlations were examined between viral copy numbers (determined by qPCR) and the relative abundances of the microbiome (16S rRNA sequencing). Spearman’s rho correlation values between EBV or HSV-1 viral abundance and relative abundances of the salivary microbiome are shown in the heatmap in Fig.  7 . For EBV, the strongest positive correlation was observed for the candidate phyla  Gracilibacteria  and  Absconditabacteria  and the genus  Abiotrophia . The strongest inverse correlation was observed for  Oribacterium ,  Clostridiales_Family XIII,  Lachnoanaerobaculum ,  Haemophilus ,  Johnsonella , and  Stomatobaculum . No significant correlations were, however, observed between HSV-1 viral abundance and microbiome relative abundances, as all Spearman’s rho correlations were under +/− 0.3 (“weak correlations”), and none of the correlations had  p  values less than 0.05. A summary of Spearman’s rho and  p  values for all genera for each virus is summarized in Dataset S 2 .\n Fig. 7 Correlation between salivary microbiome and viral load. 16S rRNA sequences were summarized to the genus level, and a Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed between qPCR viral copy number and relative abundances of bacteria. The heatmap presented shows the Spearman’s rho values, with red representing the highest positive values (positive correlation) and light yellow representing the lowest negative values (inverse correlation). Of those that did not resolve to the genus level, but only to the family or phylum level, this is identified on the heatmap as “f_” for family level resolution and “p_” for phylum level resolution. A summary of all rho values and their associated Benjamini-Hochberg corrected  p  values are listed in Dataset  S2 Correlations were next examined between viral abundance and microbiome diversity and richness. No significant correlations between qPCR viral load and Shannon’s diversity index was observed for EBV ( p  value 0.35, tau = − 0.03) nor HSV-1 ( p  value = 0.87, tau = − 0.092). However, when microbiome richness was examined, there was a significant positive correlation for EBV ( p  value = 0.005, tau = 0.25) but not for HSV-1 ( p  value = 0.34, tau = 0.09). Discussion Viral reactivation The human microbiome has become a powerful tool to help predict and modulate health and disease. The oral microbiome specifically has been implicated in modulating oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immunity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [ 17 – 21 ]. However, there have been limited studies to date that have explored the possible interplay between the oral microbiome and latent viral reactivation and propagation [ 26 – 29 ]. One of the aims of this study was thus to determine whether there was a salivary microbiome signature that could help predict whether an astronaut would be more prone or better protected against EBV, HSV-1, or VZV reactivation. As none of the 89 saliva samples collected were positive for VZV, the analyses presented in this paper are based on EBV (30% of samples positive) and HSV-1 (22% of samples positive). A positive correlation was found between EBV copy number (qPCR viral data) and bacterial richness (an alpha diversity measure of 16S rRNA observed sequences) which suggests that as the number of bacterial strains increase within a sample, the viral load also increases. In relation to health and disease, high bacterial richness in the saliva has been associated with poor oral health (decayed teeth, periodontitis, and poor oral hygiene) [ 31 ,  32 ], and in the vagina, high bacterial diversity has been linked to bacterial vaginosis [ 33 ]. It is unknown how increased bacterial richness may promote EBV reactivation and/or replication, but one possibility is that certain strains, that may be beneficial in maintaining latency and/or curbing viral growth, become diluted in the sample (i.e., relative abundance decreases) and thus do not have as profound an impact on the host. Another hypothesis could be that the additional strains not present in virus negative samples produce metabolites that (i) induce reactivation, (ii) directly interact with the viral particle to increase propagation, and/or (iii) minimize the ability of the host to properly clear viral particles. To note, there is the possibility that weakening of the astronauts’ immune response during spaceflight facilitates EBV reactivation and the growth of bacterial strains that otherwise would be controlled by the immune response, remaining undetected.

  "methods": "Methods Saliva sample collection and DNA extraction Saliva samples were collected from 10 male astronauts at various time points over the course of their mission. The duration of spaceflight ranged from 2–9 months with an average ISS mission being 4.4 months. Samples were collected (i) two times pre-flight, at 180 days (L-180) and 90 (L-90) days before launch, (ii) three times during flight, at early (1–2 months on ISS) and mid (2–4 months on ISS), and late (10 days before landing) time points and (iii) four times post-flight, on landing day (R + 0), 30 days (R + 30), 60 days (R + 60), and 180 days (R + 180) after return. These time points were adjusted (+/− 30 days) according to the convenience of crew members. The samples were collected by the astronauts themselves by placing a synthetic polymer swab (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA) in one’s mouth and swirling it around for 2–3 min until saturation. The samples were stored at − 80 °C until ready to process. Once all samples from a given subject was collected, they were thawed and then centrifuged at ×1400 g  for 5 min to separate the fluid from the swab. The separated fluid was stored at − 80 °C until DNA extraction and the swab discarded. DNA isolation The frozen fluid was allowed to thaw on ice and then vortexed and centrifuged at ×16,000g for 20 min to make a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 μL PBS. DNA was extracted from this re-suspended pellet with a QIA-Amp DNA kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD). DNA concentration was determined with the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc. Wilmington, DE). Detection and quantification of EBV, HSV-1, and VZV Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a TaqMan 7900 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using fluorescence-based amplification. Two microliters of viral DNA was added to 2× TaqMan TM  Fast Universal PCR master mix (Thermofischer, USA), with primers added to a final concentration of 100 nmol and probes added to a final concentration of 50 nmol. Primer sequences and probes for the herpes viruses (EBV, VZV, and HSV-1) along with the glyceraldehyde 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) DNA sequences are listed in Table  1  and have been described previously [ 22 ]. Viral DNA standards generated from each herpes virus ranging from 10 0  to 10 6  copies/μl were included in all reactions. Reactions were performed in triplicate and were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s, and 60 °C for 20 s. A sample was considered negative for virus if it had lower than 10 copies of viral DNA.\n Table 1 Primer and probe sequences used for the viral load estimation Name Sequence VZV (gene 63) 5′-CGCGTTTTGTACTCCGGG-3′ (forward) 5'-ACGGTTGATGTCCTCAACGAG-3′ (reverse) 5'-TGGGAGATCCACCCGGCCAG-3′ (probe) VZV (gene 21) 5′-TGTTGGCATTGCCGTTGA-3′ (forward) 5′-ATAGAAGGACGGTCAGGAACCA-3′ (reverse) 5′-CTGCTTCCCCAGCACGTCCGTC-3",

All three metrics showed that microbiome diversity and richness increased during spaceflight ( P  < 0.05) but then dropped back to pre-flight levels upon return to Earth (Fig.  1 ).\n Fig. 1 Alpha diversity of salivary microbiome.

On the other hand, while pre-flight and in-flight samples did not show significant differences in richness (though the number of observed  Streptococcus  sequences did decrease slightly in-flight), there was a significant decrease in the number of streptococcal sequences in samples collected post-flight (Figure S 1 B).

Even though EBV and HSV-1 are both members of the herpesvirus family ( Herpesviridae ), the microbiome-viral interactions may differ and thus varied responses will ensue. The Spearman’s correlation analysis showed an inverse correlation between EBV copy number and the relative abundances of the genera  Oribacterium ,  Lachnoanaerobaculum ,  Haemophilus ,  Johnsonella , and  Stomatobaculum , which, with the exception of  Haemophilus , all belong to the  Lachnospiraceae  family. These genera could also accurately predict, as indicated by random forests, whether a saliva sample was positive or negative ",
  "conclusion": "Conclusions This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions."
