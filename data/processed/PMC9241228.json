  "abstract": "Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months. Methods Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results. Results Staphylococcus  sp. and  Malassezia  sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 10 5  cfu/m 2 Conclusions Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity. \n Video Abstract Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-022-01293-0.",

  "full_text": "Introduction The microbiome of the built environment has been increasingly linked to human health and disease. The composition of built environments is largely influenced by its occupants [ 1 – 4 ] but can also be affected by external features such as seasonal variations [ 5 ,  6 ], architectural design [ 7 ], and level of urbanization [ 8 ]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique hermetically sealed built environment and being one of the most isolated inhabited built environments; access to it is highly controlled and limited. In between the routine arrival of new supplies and crew members, the ISS is completely isolated from external microbial sources. The arrival of new crew members and supplies is therefore the only source for introducing new micro-organisms to the ISS. These isolated conditions have raised concerns about the introduction and proliferation of potentially harmful microorganisms into the microbial communities of piloted spaceflight and how this could affect human health. For decades, space-faring nations were interested in the influence of microgravity, radiation, and other spaceflight conditions on the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. During the Apollo program, NASA collected pre- and post-flight samples from locations within the Command Module as part of a program to identify medically relevant microbes and to elucidate changes in the crew microflora [ 9 ]. Subsequently, Skylab surfaces were swabbed pre-launch and periodically throughout the three manned missions to characterize the bacterial exchange between the crew and internal surfaces [ 10 ]. The Soviet Union regularly monitored the microflora of Salyut 6, 7, and Mir during their operation. Onboard station Mir, air samples were collected approximately once a month, and surface samples from various locations throughout the spacecraft were collected at the end of each mission [ 11 – 13 ]. Thorough monitoring onboard Mir revealed potential health and equipment risks from the bacteria and fungi that colonized the interior surfaces [ 14 ]. These culture-based surveillance procedures were instrumental in developing the microbial surveillance standards for the ISS [ 15 ,  16 ]. Since inception, to maintain the cleanliness of ISS, traditional culture-based approaches are being used and microbial burden measured. However, research activities are being conducted to characterize the microbiome of ISS surfaces and air using state-of-the-art molecular techniques. Air, water, and surface samples were collected during the initial stage of habitation of the ISS to identify the baseline microbiota [ 17 ]. Since then, several studies have investigated the microbial population of ISS dust [ 18 – 20 ], surfaces [ 21 ,  22 ], and water [ 23 ]. In addition to cataloging the microbial population of the ISS, studies have also focused on the persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [ 24 ] and pathogens [ 25 ] onboard the ISS. These investigations provide important information for the long-term health and safety of crew members. The previous Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) study [ 26 ] examined the community structure and function of eight ISS surfaces over a period of 14 months, during three sampling sessions. The Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) study continued this objective and further sampled the same surface locations over the course of 1.5 years, during four additional flight sessions. In this paper, the MT-2 samples were analyzed for species presence and stability of the entire microbial community. The microbial diversity and composition for each location and time point were characterized to reveal how the microbial population was changing over time. The persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes was also analyzed to evaluate the stability of the ISS resistome in a changing microbiome. Co-occurrence analysis between bacterial and fungal species was analyzed to gain insight into the microbial associations in this unique built environment. Genomes were assembled from the metagenome reads (referred to as metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs) with taxonomy and functional assessment analyses performed on these MAGs. This paper also compared the results obtained during the previous MT-1 study. Together, these studies provide snapshots of the microbial population on the ISS across 5 years, allowing for dynamics and stability patterns of the surface microbiome to be evaluated. Results Thirty-two surface samples were collected over the course of 14 months (2017–2018) from the ISS. The locations sampled are listed in Table  1  and correspond to the same eight locations that were sampled during the MT-1 study that ran from 2015 to 2016 [ 26 ]. In addition to the sampling wipes, wipes that were taken out of the kits and exposed to the ISS environment (but not used for sampling) were designated as controls and processed alongside the samples. The flight sampling sessions are denoted as flights 4–7 (F4–F7), while the flight sampling sessions for the previously published MT-1 study are denoted as flights 1–3 (F1–F3). Table 1 Locations sampled across the International Space Station. All eight 8 locations were sampled over the course of four different flights—flight 4 (F4), flight 5 (F5), flight 6 (F6), and flight 7 (F7). Flight 4 was sampled in 2017, and F5, F6, and F7 were sampled throughout 2018 Location number Location description ISS module L1 Port panel next to the cupola Node 3 L2 Waste and hygiene compartment Node 3 L3 Advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) foot platform Node 3 L4 Dining table Node 1 L5 Overhead 4 Node 1 L6 Permanent multipurpose module (PMM) Port 1 PMM L7 Lab 3 overhead LAB L8 Port crew quarters, bump out exterior aft wall Node 2 Microbial burden All microbial domains of life were detected on the ISS, with bacteria being the most represented (82%), followed by fungi (10%), viruses (0.06%), and archaea (0.03%), along with reads that could not be identified (7%) (Dataset S 1 ). Of the total population, 38% could be attributed to viable organisms, based on the read counts obtained from propidium monoazide (PMA)-treated samples (which measures viable/intact organisms), with bacteria still being the most dominant group [bacteria (58%), fungi (37%), viruses (0.01%), archaea (0.004%), unclassified (4%)] (Dataset S 1 ). The viable bacterial and fungal load was compared between F4 to F7. The average bacterial read count across all four flights was 7 × 10 5  counts/m 2 , with no statistically significant differences between them (Fig.  1 A). This contrasts with the fungal read counts which did differ between flights, with F6 having the highest average sequence reads at 7.0 × 10 5  counts/m 2  (Fig.  1 B). Fig. 1 Metagenomic read counts obtained from surface wipes sampled during flights 4–7. Each dot of the graph represents a location sampled on the ISS. The line represents the average read count for a specific flight from all eight locations. PMA-treated samples were analyzed which measures viable/intact cells.  A  Read counts of the bacterial population.  B  Read counts of the fungal population. The Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance test, followed by the post hoc false discovery rate was used to compare the read counts between flights Plate count assays were also performed. The cultivable bacterial burden was highest at F6, with an average of 2.7 × 10 6  cfu/m 2 , and lowest at F7, with 1.0 × 10 2  cfu/m 2  (Fig. S 1 A). F6 also had the highest cultivable fungal burden at 1.1 × 10 4  cfu/m 2 , with F7 having below detectable fungal counts (Fig. S 1 A). Microbial diversity Alpha diversity Three alpha diversity indices were used to measure the microbial diversity within each sample: observed richness (Fig.  2 , top panel), exponentiated Shannon index (Fig.  2 , middle), and reciprocal Simpson index (Fig.  2 , bottom). Included for comparison were also the MT-1 samples from F1–F3. The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used to determine the differences between flights, and no significant differences were observed across any of the seven flights. There were also no differences across any of the eight locations sampled (Fig. S 2 ). Fig. 2 Alpha diversity metrics for MT-1 and MT-2 samples. The species richness (top row), exponentiated Shannon index (middle row), and inverse Simpson index (bottom row) are shown for each sample. Samples are grouped by flight group and colored by surface location Beta diversity Comparison between surface samples was visualized using principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) using Euclidean distances (Fig.  3 ) and organized by location (Fig.  3 A) and flight (Fig.  3 B) to identify possible trends. No apparent microbiome differences were observed between locations; however, samples did appear to cluster by flight group. These observations were supported by PERMANOVA analysis of the Euclidean distances which found a significant difference between centroids and dispersions of the flight groups ( P  < 0.001) but not between the locations ( P  = 0.229). Surface samples were also visualized and analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using Jaccard distances (Fig. S 3 ), and the same trends were noted as with the PCoA data above. Fig. 3 PCoA plot of MT-1 and MT-2 surface samples. Samples were colored by surface location ( A ) and flight group ( B ) to visualize the sample clustering. The distance between the samples was determined using the Euclidean distance Taxonomic profile of ISS microbial community The top 12 most abundant bacterial species across all surface samples are shown in Fig.  4  with all but one being associated with the human microbiome.  Propionibacterium acnes  and the six  Staphylococcus  spp.:  Staphylococcus aureus ,  Staphylococcus capitis ,  Staphylococcus epidermidis ,  Staphylococcus hominis ,  Staphylococcus saprophyticus , and  Staphylococcus  sp. AL1, reside on the skin and mucous membranes of humans.  Haemophilus parainfluenzae ,  Rothia mucilaginosa , and  Streptococcus mitis  are part of the normal oral microbiome.  Corynebacterium  sp. GD7 (reclassified as  Corynebacterium ihumii ) was first isolated from a fecal sample.  Lactococcus lactis  is used in the dairy industry for the production of various cheeses and buttermilk. The read counts for the top 12 bacteria, organized by flight and location (including controls), are shown in Fig. S 4 . Fig. 4 Top 12 most abundant bacterial species across all surface samples. The percent of mapped reads for each species in each sample. Samples were grouped in columns by surface location and arranged in order by flight group. “Other” refers to those bacterial species detected that were not in the top 12 The top 12 most abundant fungal species across all surface samples are shown in Fig.  5 . These include  Malassezia globose ,  Malassezia restricta , and  Malassezia sympodialis  which are part of the healthy skin microflora. The  Malassezia  species constitute the majority of fungal reads in most surface samples regardless of location.  Rhodotorula glutinis  and  Yarrowia lipolytica  are common environmental fungi, and  Aspergillus kawachii ,  Cyberlindnera jadinii , and  Debaryomyces hansenii  are used in the food industry.  Blumeria graminis  (barley powdery mildew),  Penicillium aurantiogriseum  (asparagus and strawberry pathogen),  Puccinia striiformis  (Stripe rust), and  Puccinia triticina  (wheat leaf rust) are all associated with plant diseases but pose no known harm to human health. The read counts for the top 12 fungi, organized by flight and location (including controls), are shown in Fig. S 5 . Fig. 5 Top 12 most abundant fungal species across all surface samples.

Samples were grouped in columns by surface location and arranged in order by flight group. “Other” refers to those fungal species detected that were not in the top 12 Differential abundance analysis of taxa was performed at the species level. Samples were grouped by flight group (i.e., F4, F5, F6, and F7) or location (i.e., dining table, crew quarters, etc.) for analysis. While there were no differentially abundant species across locations ( P  < 0.05), there were 20 differentially abundant species across flights ( P  < 0.05) (Table  2 ).

PMA-treated samples were analyzed to determine which viable bacterial and fungal genera were found to co-associate with each other. The top 50 most abundant bacteria and fungi were included in the analysis. As seen from the genus association profile in Fig. S 6 ,  Aspergillus  had the most co-associations, with other fungi and bacteria while  Pseudomonas  did not have any. The gene association matrix in Fig.  6  shows which bacteria and fungi co-occurred with each other. Of the bacteria and fungi that were included in the analysis, the associations were all positive (i.e., presence of one likely means the presence of another) with no negative associations (i.e., presence of one likely means the absence of another). Fig. 6 Co-occurrence analysis. The co-occurrence analysis was performed using the 50 most abundant genera to determine the associations among organisms. The matrix shows which genera co-occurred with each other. Blue shows the positive co-occurrences (i.e., if you find one in the community, it is likely you will find another—for example,  Aspergillus  and  Fusarium ), yellow shows the negative co-occurrences (i.e., if you find one, it is likely the other will be absent), and gray shows the random occurrences that are most likely due to random chance alone—for example,  Cladosporium  and  Fusarium Antimicrobial resistance profiles Twenty-nine AMR categories were detected in the metagenomics dataset with multidrug and macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin (MLS) resistance having the highest read counts and found in all 32 samples (Fig. S 7 ). Bacitracin, beta-lactam, diaminopyrimidine, and tetracycline resistance were also found across all samples, except from F6_1S (surface location # 1 [cupola], F6; Fig. S 7 ). The “unclassified” category was also found in all samples (except F6_1S), and the genes that were grouped into this category were all DNA-binding regulatory proteins involved in the stress response. Of the 29 AMR categories detected above, 17 were detected in the PMA-treated group. Multidrug and MLS resistance genes still had the highest counts, though were not found in every sample, as in the non-PMA group (Fig.  7 ). Fig. 7 Heat map of the ISS viable resistome. The metagenomic dataset was analyzed with DeepARG to look for anti-microbial resistance genes. The genes were then grouped into classes of resistance (i.e., “beta-lactam”), which is displayed in this heatmap ( y -axis). The heatmap shows the relative abundance of each resistance class in each sample collected, with red being the most abundant and green the least. Gray indicates zero counts detected in that sample. The samples analyzed ( x -axis) are from the PMA-treated samples which detect viable/intact cells.  x -axis naming: Fx_xS_P, with F referring to the flight (i.e., F4) and S referring to the location of the surface sampled (i.e., 1S is location 1, the port panel next to the cupola). The AMR counts were normalized based on the 16S rRNA counts Multi-dimensional scaling analysis comparing MT-2 and MT-1 samples (both PMA and non-PMA treated) showed no differences in the AMR profiles between the two studies, suggesting that the ISS resistome is relatively stable (Fig.  8 ). Fig. 8 Comparison of ISS viable resistome among flights. NMDS plot comparing the antimicrobial resistance profile of the ISS community. Metagenomic data collected from the PMA-treated samples (viable/intact cells) during each of the flight sampling sessions for both the current MT-2 study (F4–F7) and the previous MT-1 study (F1–F3) was analyzed by DeepARG. Each dot represents a sample and takes into account the presence of an antimicrobial resistance gene and its abundance. Locations are depicted by colors and MT-1 vs MT-2 study, by symbols Metagenome-assembled genomes Metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed from the 32 samples collected during flights 4–7, with 82 MAGs able to be assembled using a 50% minimum completion cutoff. Of those 82, 15 had over 90% completion. The percent completion, contamination, GC content, taxonomy, N50 (a measure of assembly quality), and genome size are summarized in Dataset S 2 . The heatmap in Fig.  9  shows the distribution and abundance of each MAG across all samples. Fig. 9 MAG abundance heatmap. Genomes were assembled from the metagenomics reads and placed into “bins,” with each “bin” representing one metagenomic assembled genome (“MAG”). These bins were generated from the metagenomic data consisting of the 32 samples collected during the course of the study. Each bin is shown on the  y -axis. The abundances are expressed as genome copies per million reads and presented, with the log10 values plotted. Red represents a high relative abundance and blue a low relative abundance. The white color represents the absence of that bin in the sample. The bin numbers were highlighted based on the phylum it was assigned to, with yellow = Actinobacteria, green = Firmicutes, blue = Bacteroidetes, and purple = Proteobacteria. Full taxonomic info for each bin can be found in Dataset S 2 . The  x -axis shows the sample that was analyzed and the relative abundance of that bin (i.e., MAG) in that sample.  x -axis naming: Fx_xS, with F referring to the flight (i.e., F4) and S referring to the location of the surface sampled (i.e., 1S is location 1, the port panel next to the cupola) To extract functional information from these MAGs, annotation was performed on each MAG. Clusters of orthologous groups (COG) information was extracted from each annotated MAG and compiled together to provide a functional assessment of the collective microbial community, with the complete list of each COG ID presented in Dataset S 3 . Each annotated gene with a COG ID was then grouped together based on COG functional categories and the proportion of each functional category represented in the pie chart in Fig.  10 . The most represented functional groups were amino acid transport and metabolism (12%); translation, ribosomal structure,",

  "methods": "Methods Sample kit preparation and sample collection Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA) by moistening polyester wipes (9″ × 9″; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ), each with 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Moistened wipes were aseptically transferred to a sterile zip lock bag and then assembled into the ISS sampling kit (at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC)), which also contained sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190), benzalkonium chloride wipes (Hygea®, PDI-BZK  D35185 ), and sterile bitran bags (VWR, Cat. 4742-S) for return. The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. Eight different locations were sampled on the ISS using the premoistened polyester wipes which were the same locations as those sampled during the previous microbial tracking study (MT-1). The list of locations sampled is presented in Table  1 . Flight 4 sampling occurred in 2017, and flight 5, 6, and 7 sampling occurred in 2018. A diagram of locations can be found in Figure 1 of the MT-1 published manuscript [ 26 ]. As per the study requirements, there was no cleaning at least 4 days prior to sampling. Cleaning outside that time frame was conducted as per routine ISS activities and was performed with disinfectant wipes containing octyl decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.0399%), dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10% C16) dimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and dimethylbenzylammonium chloride (0.0532%). During each flight sampling session, the same crew member sampled each of the eight locations. Using the sterile gloves from the sampling kit, he/she sampled 1 m 2  with the pre-moistened polyester wipes and donned a new pair of individually packed sterile gloves before sampling the next location. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each flight session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to the ISS and brought back to Earth along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. After sample collection, the samples were stored at 4 °C in orbit and then returned to Earth after 10 days for flight 4, 8 days for flight 5, 22 days for flight 6, and 11 days for flight 7. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after arrival to Earth at 4 °C with processing at JPL commencing within 2 h of receipt. Sample processing Sample processing took place in a cleanroom at JPL. In a certified biosafety cabinet, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500-mL bott",

The cultivable bacterial burden was highest at F6, with an average of 2.7 × 10 6  cfu/m 2 , and lowest at F7, with 1.0 × 10 2  cfu/m 2  (Fig. S 1 A). F6 also had the highest cultivable fungal burden at 1.1 × 10 4  cfu/m 2 , with F7 having below detectable fungal counts (Fig. S 1 A). Microbial diversity Alpha diversity Three alpha diversity indices were used to measure the microbial diversity within each sample: observed richness (Fig.  2 , top panel), exponentiated Shannon index (Fig.  2 , middle), and reciprocal Simpson index (Fig.  2 , bottom). Included for comparison were also the MT-1 samples from F1–F3. The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used to determine the differences between flights, and no significant differences were observed across any of the seven flights. There were also no differences across any of the eight locations sampled (Fig. S 2 ). Fig. 2 Alpha diversity metrics for MT-1 and MT-2 samples. The species richness (top row), exponentiated Shannon index (middle row), and inverse Simpson index (bottom row) are shown for each sample. Samples are grouped by flight group and colored by surfac",
  "discussion": "Discussion The microbiome of eight surfaces from across the ISS was sampled during four separate sampling sessions (F4–F7). The viable microbiome was assessed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing of samples that had been treated with PMA, as well as with plate count assays. Both techniques were consistent in their results, showing that the microbiome was similar across all eight locations for a given flight and validates what was previously published for MT-1 [ 26 ,  28 ] and with other ISS surface microbiome studies [ 29 ]. The spatial uniformity in this hermetically sealed, closed habitat suggests that microbial movement occurs readily, which should be taken into consideration if a situation arises that requires microbial sequestration. While no spatial differences were found, temporal differences did exist, with different microbial profiles and microbial loads observed among the various flights, consistent with our previous analyses [ 26 ,  28 ]. One influence driving these temporal differences could be the different cohorts of astronauts onboard the ISS during each sampling session. Two recent studies have noted that the crew microbiome may shape microbial composition on ISS habitable surfaces [ 29 ,  30 ], and in this study, the majority of bacteria and fungi that were detected from surfaces were human-associated, such as  Staphylococcus ,  Propionibacterium ,  Streptococcus ,  Haemophilus , and  Malassezia  or those related to food products that are ingested by humans, such as  Aspergillus kawachii  and  Lactococcus lactis . Astronaut-ISS surface exchange would parallel what has been found with Earth-based built environment studies, where human occupation significantly impacts a given indoor environment [ 2 ,  31 ,  32 ]. To garner a better understanding of just how significant human-environment interactions are in shaping the microbiomes of the ISS and the astronauts residing there, ongoing analyses by the MT-2 project team are examining astronaut data at pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight time points and examining their microbiomes in conjunction with the ISS surface microbiome. Staphylococcus  sp. and  Malassezia  sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. While bacteria dominated the ISS microbiome in both the PMA and non-PMA samples, it is worth noting that the proportion of fungi increased from 10% in the total population (viable/dead) to 37% in the viable population, while bacteria decreased from 82% (total) to 58% (viable). This would suggest that viable/intact fungal cells are more readily captured when ISS surfaces are sampled, compared to bacteria. This could be because these fungi are able to withstand the routine cleaning regimes on the ISS or the conditions surrounding the sample storage/descent to Earth/sample processing, better than those bacteria. In addition to examining which microbes were present, we also examined their properties, which may help inform policies and practices",
  "conclusion": "Conclusion Utilizing various metagenomics analyses as well as culture, this paper has provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, how the microbiome and resistome changes over time and space, and the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built environment. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity."
