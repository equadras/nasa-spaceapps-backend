However, the influence of this environment on host–pathogen interactions remains poorly understood. Here we report our results from the STL-IMMUNE study flown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-131, which investigated multi-omic responses (transcriptomic, proteomic) of human intestinal epithelial cells to infection with  Salmonella  Typhimurium when both host and pathogen were simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. To our knowledge, this was the first in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells.",

  "full_text": "Humans will travel to space more frequently and for longer duration as the rapidly growing spaceflight industry enables more routine access for both professional astronauts and the public. Spaceflight can adversely affect multiple aspects of human physiology, including immune and gastrointestinal function 1 – 4 . While pre-flight screening and quarantine procedures have reduced infection incidence, astronauts and cargo can still harbor opportunistic and obligate pathogens, including  Salmonella  spp., which have been recovered from both crew refuse and International Space Station (ISS) surfaces 5 – 8 . We previously discovered that spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture increased the virulence and stress resistance of the foodborne pathogen,  Salmonella enterica  serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella ) 9 – 12 . These environments have also been shown to increase the virulence and/or alter pathogenesis-related phenotypes of other microorganisms 13 – 16 . Collectively, these findings indicate an increased risk for infection during space travel and underscore the need for a more in-depth understanding of the similarities and differences between spaceflight and ground-based infection mechanisms. Studies performed in spaceflight and spaceflight analog environments have revealed unexpected physiological responses in both mammalian and microbial cells 14 , 15 . This is not surprising given that physical forces in the cellular microenvironment (including those associated with microgravity) profoundly alter both host and pathogen phenotypes through mechanotransduction 17 . An integrated network involving the cytoskeleton, cell surface receptors, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) mediates the dynamic three-dimensional (3D) interactions between host cells and their external environment to regulate cellular responses 17 – 19 . Since spaceflight alters the organization and/or expression of these classes of proteins 14 , 20 , 21 , it is logical to predict that this environment could impact infection processes for invasive pathogens like  Salmonella  that hijack the host and actively exploit these structural networks to enable their invasion and dissemination 22 , 23 . From the pathogen perspective, we previously discovered that spaceflight analog culture of  Salmonella  in the Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor led to increased virulence in mice 24 , enhanced stress resistance 9 – 11 , 24 , global transcriptional and proteomic reprogramming 11 , 12 , 24  and enhanced the colonization of a human 3D intestinal co-culture model (JB, SY, RRD, RJF, CMO, JS, CAN; manuscript in preparation). Space Shuttle experiments aboard STS-115 and STS-123 independently confirmed RWV trends by demonstrating that spaceflight increased the virulence and globally altered the transcriptomic and proteomic responses of  Salmonella  relative to identical ground controls 9 , 10 . Supplementation of select ions in the media was able to counteract this spaceflight-associated increased virulence 10 . It is important to note that  Salmonella  virulence studies were performed when the bacteria were cultured in spaceflight, brought back to Earth and immediately used in animal infections (i.e., the host was not exposed to spaceflight). Transcriptional profiling revealed a central role for the RNA-binding protein Hfq in the response of  Salmonella  to both spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture in the RWV 9 , 10  and subsequent studies indicated altered expression of  hfq  or the Hfq regulon in other microbes 25 – 28 . In this study, we investigated how spaceflight culture alters the response of human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) to infection by  Salmonella  when both the host and pathogen were exposed to spaceflight. The experiment was flown as part of the Space Tissue Loss (STL) payload and operationally designated as STL-IMMUNE, since epithelial cells are excellent sentinels of innate immunity by providing the first physical and chemical barriers to infection and coordinating additional innate and mucosal defenses and subsequent adaptive responses 29 , 30 . Since in-flight technical limitations precluded the use of gentamicin protection assays to quantify bacterial invasion into the epithelium, we focused our analysis on transcriptomic (dual RNA-seq of host and pathogen) and proteomic profiling (Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification/iTRAQ). These global analyses can yield valuable insight into the status of healthy and infected cells. Figure  1  shows the experimental design and timeline for STL-IMMUNE and schematic of hollow fiber bioreactors used for 3D cell culture. HT-29 cells were seeded into the extracapillary space (ECS) of hollow fiber bioreactors which contained collagen I-coated capillary fibers for intestinal cell attachment. Oxygenated and CO 2 -containing media was continually perfused through the intracapillary space (ICS) of the fibers (underneath the basal side of the cells, which also prevented exposure of cells to high fluid shear forces). During spaceflight,  Salmonella  was introduced to the apical side of HT-29 cultures through ECS ports and allowed to incubate for 6 h before fixative was perfused through the ICS. Fig. 1 STL-IMMUNE experimental design and impact of spaceflight on uninfected HT-29 transcriptional profiles. a  Hollow fiber bioreactor technology. Photo and cross-sectional schematic of the hollow fiber bioreactors used in this study. Hollow fibers had a pore size of 0.3 µm to retain bacteria within the extracapillary space (ECS) while still facilitating nutrient and gas exchange via diffusion as oxygenated media was perfused through the intracapillary space (ICS).  b  STL-IMMUNE experimental design. HT-29 cells and bacteria were prepared as shown (see “Methods” section for additional detail). Bioreactors, bacteria, and fixative bags were integrated into the CCM hardware and launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery mission STS-131. Crew members activated the CCM once on orbit. At mission elapsed day 11, cultures were infected with  S . Typhimurium for 6 h and fixed for postflight analysis.

The authors affirm that informed consent for publication of the images in Fig. 1 was provided. Between uninfected flight and ground HT-29 cultures, RNA-seq profiling showed significant differences in 307 genes (≥2-fold change; false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05; Fig.  1c  and Supplementary Table  1 ). Evaluation of the top 5 significantly upregulated genes revealed the enhanced expression of several transcripts belonging to the small proline-rich (SPRR) family as well as  DHRS9  (a retinol dehydrogenase) and tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (Fig.  1c ).  SPRR  genes encode mechanosensitive proteins that play roles in barrier function, differentiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, wound healing and cancer 31 . They are also likely involved in the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to biomechanical stress 32 . Their expression is regulated by ECM/integrin interactions and by various stimuli, including UV radiation, inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and retinoids 31 , 33 . Gene ontology (GO) analysis of upregulated genes indicated enrichment in type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling/antiviral defense, DNA replication, and differentiation (including the SPRR genes) (Fig.  1c , Supplementary Table  2 ). The upregulation of viral defense genes was also previously observed in the livers of mice following spaceflight 34 . IFN-I signaling is complex and context dependent, regulating a broad range of cellular processes 35 , 36 . In addition to modulating innate and adaptive immune defenses against pathogens, IFN-I regulates intestinal homeostasis, including epithelial cell proliferation, and barrier function 36 , 37 . IFN-I signaling is often associated with decreased proliferation to promote differentiation, cellular repair, or defense against infection 36 , 37 . We found that genes important for glycolysis ( SLC2A3 ,  HK2 ,  PFKFB3, PFKFB4, PDK1)  and fatty acid metabolism ( FADS1, FADS2, ELOVL5, EHHADH ,  SIRT4 ) were downregulated in flight (Supplementary Table  1 ). Previous spaceflight studies using either cultured macrophages 38  or murine liver tissue 34  also saw the suppression of multiple glycolytic enzymes, with the latter study postulating a model linking spaceflight changes in cellular metabolism, ROS, and immune dysregulation 34 . The downregulation of these bioenergetic pathways in our study could indicate the reduced proliferation of the flight cultures, which could result from a number of phenotypes, including decreased tumorigenicity/increased differentiation, increased DNA damage or apoptosis. During cancer metabolism, glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis is often elevated 39 . Several genes highly expressed in tumors or undifferentiated cells were also downregulated in flight, including  CA9, CA12, CEACAM6, ITGA5, CLDN2 ,  COL5A2 ,  VIM ,  PROM1 , and  LGR4  (Supplemental Table  1 ). Together, these trends may indicate decreased tumorigenicity of the flight cells.  Salmonella  is known to preferentially colonize cancer cells 40 , thus differences in tumorigenicity between flight and ground cultures could impact infection. Of relevance, we previously showed that RWV culture of HT-29 cells induced a more normal, differentiated phenotype relative to controls 41 . Although in our present study we saw indicators of increased differentiation of the flight cultures, there were also some potential indicators of increased tumorigenicity (e.g., downregulation of  VIL ,  TP53I11 , upregulation of  CCAT1;  Supplemental Table  1 ). In addition, LGR4 is also important for Paneth cell differentiation 42 . A reduction in Paneth cells could diminish antimicrobial defenses. Host metabolism is also important in the context of an impending infection as the pathogen must scavenge for available nutrients 43 , 44 . Decreases in intracellular glucose could dampen intracellular pathogen replication depending on the availability of other nutrients. However,  Salmonella  has evolved an impressive metabolic plasticity to exploit diverse nutrients in parallel, even at trace levels 44 . Engagement of IFN-I signaling and decreased expression of metabolic genes could also indicate increased apoptosis. However, pro-apoptotic genes  BNIP3  and  BNIP3L  were downregulated in flight, suggesting reduced apoptosis. A previous spaceflight study 45  showed reduced apoptosis and increased differentiation in MIP-101 colon cells, as well as increased expression of carcinoembryonic antigen proteins (often upregulated in colon cancer). In our study, we observed the downregulation of  CEACAM6  (Supplementary Table  1 ). IFN-I signaling can also be activated by the DNA damage response following exposure to radiation, oxidative stress, or other harmful stimuli. DNA damage can occur during spaceflight due to radiation exposure and oxidative stress, including in the gastrointestinal tract 46 – 49 . Chromosomal damage has been observed in astronauts 48 , 49  and we previously saw the downregulation of select DNA repair genes in astronaut blood cells 50 , which could potentially impede repair. In our present study, several genes involved in checkpoint-mediated responses to DNA damage and replication stress were upregulated ( BRCA1 ,  CLSPN, MCM10, RRM2 , and  KIAA0101) . Thus, it is also possible that changes in IFN-I and metabolic genes could be due to DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and/or radiation exposure. GO analysis of downregulated genes indicated enrichment in cellular components related to the cell surface/membrane and extracellular components as well as complement and coagulation pathways (Fig.  1c , Supplementary Table  2 ). Decreased expression of genes encoding factors classically associated with blood or other tissues was observed, including complement and fibrinogen complex proteins (e.g.,  C3, FGG, FGA , and  FGB ) (Supplementary Table  2 ). Fibrinogen and complement proteins are also expressed by epithelial cells and play an important role in infection 51 – 54 . However, as there are cases where RNA from fetal bovine serum (FBS) in culture media has been detected in mRNA analyses 55 , we cannot exclude the possibility of FBS interference. Importantly, the same batch of heat-inactivated FBS was used for identical and simultaneous preparation of all flight and ground cultures in this study. We also performed iTRAQ analysis to obtain a snapshot of the cellular proteomic profile in the uninfected flight cultures compared to ground controls. The presence of FBS in the culture media resulted in strong interference from bovine proteins; a subset of which could not be distinguished from human proteins due to their identical sequence homologies and thus were excluded from our analysis. Despite this challenge, we observed flight-associated upregulation of the major cytoskeletal proteins G-actin and tubulin, which are known targets of  Salmonella  effectors to facilitate invasion 56  (Supplementary Table  3 ). HSPA1A protein was also 2.4-fold upregulated in flight. None of these proteins were differentially regulated at the transcriptional level; however, it is fairly common to see divergence in mRNA and protein expression due to a variety of biological factors, such as alterations in posttranscriptional modifications, translation efficiency and RNA or protein stabilities (reviewed by Maier et al.) 57 . We then examined the data for the infections performed with  Salmonella  during spaceflight and in our ground controls. The experiment was designed to automatically inject 1 mL bacterial inoculum (~1 × 10 7  colony forming units (CFU)) into HT-29 cultures. Postlanding hardware inspection revealed that all flight samples received the intended volume of bacteria; however, ground controls received slightly different volumes (see “Methods” section). The 6-h incubation in the absence of gentamicin would have allowed sufficient time for the bacteria to replicate in the media during attachment and invasion, but it is unknown whether differences in initial inoculum eventually equalized. In addition, while we had sufficient material to perform iTRAQ analysis using triplicate cultures, only one infected flight sample had enough material remaining after proteomics for RNA-seq, thus we analyzed multiple technical replicates from a single flight bioreactor for that condition (see “Methods” section). Acknowledging these limitations, given the rare nature of these samples due to the inherent difficulty in performing spaceflight infections, we present a preliminary analysis of the host and pathogen response during spaceflight infection. Rather than focusing on the direct quantitative comparison between the infected flight and ground cultures, we instead focused on evaluating the gene expression patterns elicited during either a spaceflight or ground-based infection relative to their respective controls (infected vs. uninfected for flight and ground) (Fig.  2 ; Supplementary Tables  4 – 7 ). However, we also include the direct comparisons of the host response to infection between flight and ground for comparison in future studies (Supplementary Table  8 ), as well as the bacterial genes expressed above background during the flight and ground infections (Supplementary Tables  9  and  10 ) and directly between flight and ground infected cultures (Supplementary Table  11 ).

BP biological process, CC cellular component, MF molecular function. Bars in  d  indicate the results for a flight infection (yellow; flight infected/uninfected) and ground infection (gray; ground infected/uninfected). Analysis of flight and ground cultures indicates both common and distinct host transcriptional profiles in response to  Salmonella  infection (Fig.  2 ; Supplementary Tables  4 – 7 ). Overall, 35 transcripts were altered in response to infection in both flight and ground conditions; 28 genes in the same direction and 7 oppositely regulated (Fig.  2b , Supplementary Tables  4 – 7 ). Relative to their respective uninfected controls, both flight- and ground-infected cultures displayed enrichment in biological functions and pathways expected for  Salmonella -infected cultures, including the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation (TNF, IL-1, NF-κB, and NOD signaling), response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cell chemotaxis (Fig.  2d ; Supplementary Tables  5  and  7 ). Interaction of  Salmonella  with the intestinal epithelium initiates a series of signaling cascades leading to intestinal inflammation 58 . In vivo, this defensive response serves to recruit neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of infection but can also lead to the generation of ROS that confers a strategic advantage for  Salmonella  to outcompete resident microbiota 58 . Both flight and ground infections induced upregulation of  IRAK2 , a protein that plays a central role in TLR signaling to NF-κB for the production of pro-inflammatory mediators 59 . NF-κB-related genes commonly induced during both flight and ground infections included the Rel protein  NFKB2  and the atypical IκB member,  NFKBIZ  (Supplementary Tables  4  and  6 ).  RELB  and  REL , which encode distinct Rel proteins which are induced in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns/PAMPs (e.g., flagellin, LPS), were also upregulated in flight and ground infections, respectively (Supplementary Tables  4  and  6 ). In line with these observations, both flight and ground infections led to the upregulation of transcripts encoding several chemokines important for recruiting neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of infection, including  CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 ,  CXCL8 , and  CCL20 .  NFKBIZ  encodes NF-κB inhibitor zeta (IκBζ), which both represses and activates select NF-κB genes 60 . IκBζ is rapidly induced in response to infection or exposure to potent TLR stimuli and is an important inhibitor of nuclear NF-κB activity to prevent uncontrolled inflammation 61 . These findings confirm that during spaceflight,  Salmonella  can induce a subset of the kno",

  "methods": "Methods Mammalian cell lines, bacterial strains, and flight hardware The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29 (ATCC, HTB-38), was cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO 2  in GTSF-2 media (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2.25 g sodium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific) and 5 mL insulin transferrin selenite (Sigma-Aldrich) per liter. Media used to expand cells as monolayers contained Penicillin–Streptomycin (10 units/mL and 10 µg/mL, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich) and fungizone (0.5 µg/mL). Flight culture media contained only streptomycin (Sm) and fungizone. Infection studies were performed with wild-type  S . Typhimurium χ3339, a mouse-passaged derivative of SL1344 which is naturally Sm-resistant 24 . Bacteria were cultured in Lennox Broth (LB) containing 0.3 M NaCl prior to loading in the hardware, as described below. HT-29 cells were cultured in 2.2 mL hollow fiber bioreactors (Spectrum Labs) that were housed in the Cell Culture Module (CCM; Tissue Genesis). The CCM hardware enabled automated media perfusion, addition of bacteria to perform infections and sample fixation. Flight comparisons were made to identical ground controls housed in the same hardware at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The flight hardware and experimental layout are shown in Fig.  1 . Preparation of  S . Typhimurium Ten days before launch,  S . Typhimurium strain χ3339 was streaked from a glycerol stock onto LB agar plates containing 100 µg/mL Sm and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Bacterial colonies were then used to inoculate overnight cultures grown for 15–16 h. with aeration in LB media containing 0.3 M NaCl and 100 µg/mL Sm at 37 °C. Cultures were pelleted at 7000 r.p.m. and resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; Invitrogen). Bacteria were quantified by plating for viable CFU per mL and diluted to 1 × 10 7  CFU/mL in DPBS to maintain the bacteria as viable but not actively growing. On L-7, flight bacteria bags were filled with 2 mL of the cultures and maintained at room temperature until attachment to the flow paths 2 days prior to launch (L-2). Preparation of hollow fiber bioreactors, media bags and fixatives Sterile bioreactors were wetted with 70% ethanol (10 mL) and then rinsed in triplicate with 10 mL DPBS. A 1 mg/mL collagen I solution (bovine, Corning) in DPBS was then introduced through the ECS ports to coat the hollow fibers. After 1 h, bioreactors were rinsed in triplicate with DPBS through the ECS ports to remove unbound collagen. Bioreactors were rinsed in triplicate with 10 mL of warm flight medium and placed at 37 °C until ready for loading with HT-29 cells. Flight and ground control bags contained either 60 mL of flight culture media or 40 mL RNAlater II fixative (Ambion) for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Preparation and loading of HT-29 cells into flight hardware HT-29 cells were expanded as monolayers in T-75 flasks. Four days prior to launch, confluent monolayers were washed in warm Hank",
