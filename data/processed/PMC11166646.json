Without effective solutions for aerospace health ailments, increasingly critical challenges will manifest as humanity ventures into crewed interplanetary travel. Solid biopsies have traditionally served as the gold standard for molecular monitoring of human physiology, but such invasive procedures require specialized equipment and carry an increased risk of infection and regional pain. To circumvent these difficulties, researchers on Earth have started to use blood or fluid samples, which are simpler to perform and require little to no recovery time, allowing for increased temporal resolution of sampling. These minimally invasive “liquid biopsies” permit the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids 2 , 3 , which are thought to detect changes earlier than conventional protein biomarkers 4  and to better resolve molecular heterogeneity than standard tissue biopsies 5 . Cell-free nucleic acids have emerged as potential space-relevant biomarkers of psychosocial and physical stress 6 , aging 7 , metabolic disorders 8 , and inflammation 9 , and have already been successfully utilized in various terrestrial healthcare contexts, including screening for infections 10 , diagnosing cancer 11 , and monitoring cancer recurrence and therapy 12 . On a similar note, cell-free nucleic acids can infer well-documented spaceflight responses, such as DNA damage 13 , 14 , in distal tissues without the need for invasive tissue biopsies 15 , which would be particularly difficult to conduct in orbit. Longitudinal and full-body molecular profiling using cell-free nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue for advancing space healthcare. This approach may grant a detailed understanding of how the human body responds to the space environment and the development of modern countermeasures. Consenting astronauts could participate in lifetime surveillance through annual liquid biopsies, which could reveal the degree of full recovery from spaceflight responses, such as DNA damage and clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the latter of which causes increased lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease and blood cancers 16 , 17 . Liquid biopsies may be particularly constructive during interplanetary spaceflight missions, in which orbital healthcare autonomy will need to be optimized due to the large distance away from Earth. With the advent of the portable, nanopore-based Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, nucleic acids could potentially be extracted and directly sequenced in-flight by crew to monitor their own health in near real time 18 – 20 . The NASA Twins Study provided a unique opportunity to perform a multi-omics analysis with monozygotic twin astronauts, where one participant resided on the ISS for 340 days, and the other remained on Earth 16 . The past few years have now welcomed the first studies to examine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in astronauts, using data from the NASA Twins Study 21  and data collected 20 years prior with 14 astronauts on short-term missions 22 . These studies highlighted a theme of mitochondrial stress as a consistent spaceflight phenotype 23 , with bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealing mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) spikes during flight, the levels of which were correlated to time spent on the ISS 24 , and plasma analysis revealing cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) spikes during flight 21  and in the immediate days after return 22 . Here, we report an independent study with six astronaut participants, where we examined plasma cfRNA profiles that reflect the longitudinal responses of internal tissues to the spaceflight environment. To disentangle microgravity from the various factors of the spaceflight environment, we directly compared our human plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a published JAXA spaceflight mission that incorporated an artificial gravity device installed on the Japanese ISS Kibo Experiment Module 25 . Through this process, minimally invasive approaches were used in both species to gain a comprehensive overview of conserved environmental responses to microgravity, with increased mitochondrial components in plasma being one such prominent response. Results Plasma cfRNA analysis of six astronauts Blood samples were collected from six astronauts before, during, and after spaceflight on the ISS. An 11-time point sampling course was designed to capture the pre-flight baseline, the early to late phases of more than 120 days on the ISS, and the early to late phases of readaptation in the first 120 days after flight (Fig.  1a ). Total cfRNA and cfDNA were purified from plasma samples and their yields were determined (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). To verify overall sample quality, real-time PCR analysis was performed to measure the ratio of chromosomal to mitochondrial DNA in total cfDNA. Relative copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA in plasma significantly increased during spaceflight but returned to baseline levels in post-flight samples (Fig.  1b ), similar to previous reports 21 .

The 64 samples consisted of three groups (pre-, in-, and post-flight). Indicated are 466 differentially regulated genes (DRRs, red), 13 mitochondrial genes (MT-genes, green), and 8 mucin family genes (MUC-genes, brown).  e – j  Normalized quantification values from RNA-seq for mitochondrial genes and mucin family genes with mean value (solid line) and standard error of the mean (SEM, error bars). SEM values were calculated from  n  = 17 biologically independent samples, including six astronauts for pre-flight, six astronauts for in-flight, and six astronauts for post-flight, except for one Post+120 time point for which one sample was removed due to poor data quality. All 66 cfRNA samples were processed for RNA-seq analysis. Data quality was assessed based on visualization of mapped reads and principal component analysis (PCA) plots (Supplementary Figs.  2 ,  3 ). Two samples (one pre- and one post-flight) were removed from further analysis due to low sequencing library yield and poor mapping quality. PCA plots indicated variations between the six astronauts in the pre-flight phase. As these variations caused difficulties in defining pre-flight baselines, pairwise comparisons of cfRNA profiles using pre-flight baseline samples were not effective (Supplementary Fig.  4  and Supplementary Data  1 ). However, RNA profiles showed distinct differences between in-flight and post-flight samples. This allowed us to effectively identify altered RNA species between in-flight and post-flight phases, even with the relatively small number of six astronauts participating in our study (Fig.  1c, d ). All time points were consolidated into pre-, in-, and post-flight groups. Statistical analysis was performed to identify 466 differentially represented cfRNAs (DRRs) (ANOVA tool in CLC Genomics Workbench, FDR-adjusted  P -value < 0.05, |fold change| > 2, |difference| > 50, Supplementary Data  2 ). Groups of genes with similar fold-change values were identified through scatterplots, where they formed quasi-straight lines that deviated from the 45-degree diagonal (Fig.  1d ). Prominent examples included cfRNAs from mitochondrial genes (13 DRRs) and cfRNAs from mucin family genes (8 DRRs), which were increased and decreased respectively during spaceflight (Fig.  1d ). Subplots e–j in Fig.  1  show normalized quantification values for individual cfRNA species based on mapped genes throughout the time course. cfRNAs from a subset of mitochondria-encoded genes were consistently elevated from in-flight +5 days, reaching a peak at in-flight +30 days, and decreasing at post-flight +3 days. cfRNAs from mucin gene family members decreased during spaceflight and increased transiently during the post-flight phase. Molecular pathways affected by spaceflight cfRNA provides a unique opportunity to estimate molecular changes occurring in the internal tissues of the human body. To explore the functional categories of altered cfRNAs, a pathway analysis was performed using Metascape 3.5 26 . Consistent with the alteration of mitochondrial RNAs, enrichment of pathways related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected (Fig.  2a ). Identification of pathways related to the nervous system, including behavior, regulation of synapse organization, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and the neuronal system, indicated that blood sampling successfully monitored molecular responses in nervous tissues. Tissue-specificity analysis further supported the alteration of skeletal muscle and the cerebellum (Fig.  2b ). Correlation analysis of the 466 DRRs indicated two major coregulated cfRNA clusters (Supplementary Fig.  5  and Supplementary Data  3 ). Mitochondrial RNAs were clustered together, but cfRNAs linked to other pathway terms did not show clear segregation. Fig. 2 Pathway analysis of DRRs from cfRNA analysis. a  Enriched terms for the 466 DRRs from the cfRNA analysis with Log P , gene count, and gene ratio (the number of genes in each term divided by the number of genes in the same category in the database) based on our Metascape enrichment analysis.  b  Enriched tissue types of the 466 DRRs based on our Metascape PaGenBase analysis.  c – k  Relative expression values obtained by RNA-seq for DRRs under neurological and skeletal muscle terms throughout the time course. Mean value (solid line) and −/+ SEM (error bar) from the same biologically independent samples used for Fig.  1e–j  are shown.  l – o  Relative expression values obtained by RNA-seq for DRRs under vitamin D receptor signaling pathways throughout the time course. Mean values (solid line) and SEM (error bar) were calculated from the same biologically independent samples as ( c – k ). Time-course profiles of cfRNAs linked to these tissue processes indicated that baseline levels of these RNAs tended to decrease during spaceflight and recover during post-flight phases (Fig.  2c–k ). Cerebellum-related genes calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 A (CACNA1A), HR (HR lysine demethylase and nuclear receptor corepressor), immunoglobulin superfamily member 9B (IGSF9B), and paired box 6 (PAX6) and skeletal muscle-related genes immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (IGFN1), ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR), and xin actin-binding repeat containing 1 (XIRP1) showed reduction during spaceflight. RNA levels of these genes showed a rapid increase at post-flight +3 days and decreased by post-flight +120 days. Skeletal muscle-related genes MAP3K7CL (MAP3K7 C-terminal like) and SH3BGRL (SH3 domain binding glutamate-rich protein like) showed opposite changes, with increased representation during spaceflight. Similar to mitochondrial RNAs, there were delays in the changes of RNA levels for tissue-specific genes during the transition from pre-flight to in-flight phases, but re-adaptation responses to the ground environment were faster. cfRNAs from genes involved in the vitamin D receptor signaling pathway, KANK2 (KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 2), MN1 (MN1 proto-oncogene, transcriptional regulator), RXRA (retinoid X receptor alpha), and TRIM24 (tripartite motif containing 24), included a nuclear receptor and co-regulators. These RNA species were also altered in opposite directions between in-flight and post-flight phases (Fig.  2l–o ). Vitamin D plays a central role in inter-organ communication through hormones secreted by the parathyroid gland, which regulates skeletal and muscular health 27 . Changes in cfRNAs derived from these regulatory genes may indicate systemic shifts in mineral and metabolic homeostasis in space. To further evaluate the feasibility of cfRNA-based internal tissue monitoring, we decided to detect tissue- or cell-type-specific genes in the cfRNA-seq data using more strict criteria. As comprehensive human gene expression databases combined with single-cell RNA-seq, lists of genes with tissue-enriched and tissue-restricted expression were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) 28 . Out of the 466 genes derived from our cfRNA analysis, 57 genes were tissue-enriched and 10 of them were detected in a single tissue (Fig.  3a ). The majority of cfRNAs from these genes showed relatively low counts, likely due to the minor contribution of cfRNAs originating from each tissue type, but they did show consistent changes throughout the sampling time course (Fig.  3b–f ) among the six astronauts. Mapped reads were visually inspected (Fig.  3g–k ) as we did not have enough materials to perform PCR-based validation for multiple RNA species. To verify tissue-specificity with an independent database, tissue-specific genes from the HPA were compared to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx,  https://gtexportal.org/ ) database record (Fig.  3l–p ). RNA expressions from the DNM3 (dynamin 3), C1QL3 (complement C1q 3), and AMER2 (APC member recruitment protein 2) genes were highly enriched in the brain and pituitary. RNAs from the KRT2 (keratin 2) and MUC5B (mucin 5B) genes were expressed specifically in the skin and minor salivary glands among the tissues and cell types included in the HPA and GTEx database. These results support that our cfRNA-based liquid biopsy approach allowed for the detection of spaceflight-associated responses in non-blood tissues.

The horizontal axis represents the corresponding tissue types listed above the graphs. Isolation of mitochondrial fraction An increase in plasma cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA indicated the presence of extracellular mitochondria (exMT) or the release of cytosolic mitochondrial components into the bloodstream during spaceflight. As unprotected nucleic acids in plasma are expected to be highly unstable, we hypothesized that cfDNA and cfRNA derived from mitochondria may be protected inside extracellular vesicles (EVs). We decided to isolate such EVs based on cell surface antigens for further characterization, as previously described 29 . To identify potential surface markers of EVs containing mitochondrial components, a panel of 361 antibodies was screened for enrichment of mtDNA (Fig.  4a ). Antibodies were pooled and mixed with in-flight and post-flight plasma samples, and antibody-bound materials were purified. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the recovery of mtDNA in each purified material. Through three rounds of antibody screenings, only one antibody, the anti-CD36 antibody, consistently enriched mtDNA (Fig.  4b–d ). This enrichment was specific to in-flight plasma samples, consistent with the idea that mitochondrial components released in space are associated with CD36 as a surface molecular marker.

Cytosolic release of mitochondrial components has been reported in the context of various mitochondrial dysfunctions, which could be subsequently released as EVs during cell death 37 . To investigate the potential tissue origins of the mitochondrial components in plasma, RNA was isolated from the purified fraction and analyzed by RNA-seq. RNAs from 406 genes were enriched in the CD36 fraction (Fig.  4e , CLC Genomics Workbench, Empirical analysis of DGE, FDR-adjusted  P -value < 0.05, |fold change| > 2, Supplementary Data  4 ). A tissue-specificity analysis using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tools 38 , 39  revealed that the RNAs in the CD36 fraction isolated from in-flight plasma samples were derived from genes with diverse tissue-specificities. The list of tissues included the brain, skeletal and heart muscles, and relatively minor tissue types, including the retina, choroid plexus, tongue, skin, and neuroendocrine organs, namely, the pituitary, thyroid, and parathyroid glands (Fig.  4f , Supplementary Data  5 ). Some of these tissue types have not been previously analyzed, even in mouse spaceflight missions. One advantage of plasma fractionation using the anti-CD36 antibody was the successful identification of enriched RNAs that were not detectable using bulk cfRNA-seq. For example, RNAs encoded by retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65  kDa protein, retinoid isomerohydrolase (RPE65), a component of the visual cycle of the retina that is mutated in hereditary retinal dystrophy 40 , and photoreceptor cell components peripherin 2 (PRPH2) and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit beta 1 (CNGB1), both associated with retinitis pigmentosa 41 , 42 , were specifically found in the CD36 fraction. To estimate the tissue-specificity of the RNAs, expression profiles of RNAs enriched in the CD36 fraction were obtained from the GTEx database. The resulting heatmap revealed subsets of genes highly specific to the cerebellum and brain (Fig.  4g ). Other RNAs were also specific to the heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pituitary gland, skin, thyroid gland, and arteries. When the CD36 fraction was purified from post-flight plasma s",

Ethics committee approvals were obtained at the University of Tsukuba, Institute of Medicine, Ethics Committee (No. 251, November 27, 2015), JAXA Institutional Review Board for Human Research (JX-IRBA-20–071, August 30, 2016), NASA Institutional Review Board (Pro1995, February 28, 2017), and European Space Agency (ESA) Medical Board (2017_04_09, April 20, 2017). Informed consent was obtained by the personal information manager of the study, and de-identified samples were made available to researchers who performed sample processing and data analysis. The study design and conduct complied with all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants and was conducted in accordance with the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. The previously published Mouse Habitat Unit-1 (MHU-1) spaceflight mission is described by Shiba et al. 25 . Sample collection and transportation Human blood samples were collected using Vacutainer EDTA-plasma separate gel collection tubes (BD, cat. no. 362788) and frozen at −95 °C (ISS) or −80 °C (ground) after centrifugation for 30 min at 1239× g  (3800 rpm, ISS) or 1600× g  (ground). Frozen samples were transported to the University of Tsukuba after all samples were collected from the six astronauts. Mouse blood samples were collected from the inferior vena cava under anesthesia, and transferred into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube containing EDTA-2K for a final concentration of 5 mM. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1500× g  for 10 min, and collected into a fresh tube. A 100 μl aliquot was frozen and transported to the University of Tsukuba. RNA purification Plasma sample tubes were thawed on ice, aliquoted, and frozen at −80 °C. Plasma sample aliquots (120 μl) were thawed on ice, and centrifuged at 2000× g  for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and 100 μl supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with 1 ml TRIzol-LS (Life Technologies, cat. no. 10296028). 200 μl of chloroform was added to the TRIzol sample, vortex mixed, and spun at 16,000× g  for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with 1 μl of glycogen (10 mg/ml stock, Roche, cat. no. 1091393001). 500 μl of isopropanol was added, mixed, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. RNA pellets were recovered following centrifugation at 16,000× g  for 15 min and the removal of supernatants. Pellets were washed twice with 80% ethanol. RNA was resuspended in 8 μl of water.

  "results": "Results Plasma cfRNA analysis of six astronauts Blood samples were collected from six astronauts before, during, and after spaceflight on the ISS. An 11-time point sampling course was designed to capture the pre-flight baseline, the early to late phases of more than 120 days on the ISS, and the early to late phases of readaptation in the first 120 days after flight (Fig.  1a ). Total cfRNA and cfDNA were purified from plasma samples and their yields were determined (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). To verify overall sample quality, real-time PCR analysis was performed to measure the ratio of chromosomal to mitochondrial DNA in total cfDNA. Relative copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA in plasma significantly increased during spaceflight but returned to baseline levels in post-flight samples (Fig.  1b ), similar to previous reports 21 .

SEM values were calculated from  n  = 17 biologically independent samples, including six astronauts for pre-flight, six astronauts for in-flight, and six astronauts for post-flight, except for one Post+120 time point for which one sample was removed due to poor data quality. All 66 cfRNA samples were processed for RNA-seq analysis. Data quality was assessed based on visualization of mapped reads and principal component analysis (PCA) plots (Supplementary Figs.  2 ,  3 ). Two samples (one pre- and one post-flight) were removed from further analysis due to low sequencing library yield and poor mapping quality. PCA plots indicated variations between the six astronauts in the pre-flight phase. As these variations caused difficulties in defining pre-flight baselines, pairwise comparisons of cfRNA profiles using pre-flight baseline samples were not effective (Supplementary Fig.  4  and Supplementary Data  1 ). However, RNA profiles showed distinct differences between in-flight and post-flight samples. This allowed us to effectively identify altered RNA species between in-flight and post-flight phases, even with the relatively small number of six astronauts participating in our study (Fig.  1c, d ). All time points were consolidated into pre-, in-, and post-flight groups. Statistical analysis was performed to identify 466 differentially represented cfRNAs (DRRs) (ANOVA tool in CLC Genomics Workbench, FDR-adjusted  P -value < 0.05, |fold change| > 2, |difference| > 50, Supplementary Data  2 ). Groups of genes with similar fold-change values were identified through scatterplots, where they formed quasi-straight lines that deviated from the 45-degree diagonal (Fig.  1d ). Prominent examples included cfRNAs from mitochondrial genes (13 DRRs) and cfRNAs from mucin family genes (8 DRRs), which were increased and decreased respectively during spaceflight (Fig.  1d ).

  "discussion": "Discussion Consistent with reports from the NASA Twins Study 21 , we found a significant increase in relative mitochondrial DNA copy numbers within cfDNA during spaceflight but a return to baseline levels in post-flight samples (Fig.  1b ). Another recent study similarly found a significant increase in cell-free mitochondrial DNA in the plasma of 14 astronauts shortly after landing, although the authors only examined three time points (10 days before launch, day of landing, and 3 days after return) 22 . Our results indicated that the samples collected in our study could be a promising resource to further characterize molecular events associated with spaceflight across a wider range and larger number of time points. Here, we also show prominent changes in the cfRNA profiles of six astronauts undergoing long-duration spaceflight on the ISS. An increase in plasma mitochondrial components was supported by plasma mtDNA copy numbers and RNAs from mitochondrial genes. Screening with antibodies recognizing cell surface markers identified CD36, and the isolated plasma fraction contained RNA species from genes representing a broad range of tissue specificities. These results not only support the practical use of relatively less invasive blood sampling and liquid biopsy analysis to monitor physiological changes in astronauts but also provide insights into previously uncharacterized tissue types and molecular processes in the human body affected by spaceflight. cfRNA profiles indicated two distinct modes of molecular changes associated with spaceflight. One group of cfRNAs was represented by mtRNAs which increased in plasma during spaceflight. Another group of cfRNAs was represented by RNAs encoded by mucin genes which decreased during spaceflight. As DNA and RNA molecules exposed to plasma are thought to be highly unstable due to the nuclease activity, we speculated cell-free mtDNAs and mtRNAs in plasma may exist as contents of EVs. Through screening a panel of antibodies, we identified anti-CD36 antibodies that enriched cf-mtDNA from spaceflight plasma samples. In this study, we could not obtain conclusive results to determine whether plasma mitochondrial components represented intact exMTs or cytosolic mitochondrial DNAs and RNAs included in EVs. exMT release into plasma under metabolic stress and tissue injury has been proposed as a defensive mechanism, whereby damaged mitochondria are ejected to protect host cells 32 , 59 . Mitochondrial DNA released into the cytosol is posited as one of the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immune pathways 60 . Multiple studies suggest inter-cellular trafficking of damaged mitochondria and ROS as a signal to induce resistance against metabolic stress in distal cells and organs 31 , 61 . Our results support that a broad range of tissues release mitochondrial components into the plasma during spaceflight, which may indicate systemic metabolic stress responses in the human body under microg",
