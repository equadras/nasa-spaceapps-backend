  "abstract": "The wasps  Leptopilina heterotoma  parasitize and ingest their  Drosophila  hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for  L .  heterotoma  EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in  Drosophila . The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that  L .  heterotoma  infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of  L .  heterotoma  infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside,  L .  heterotoma  EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as  Rab5  knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for  L .  heterotoma  are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Parasitoid (parasitic) wasps have an obligatory relationship with their insect hosts. Engaged in a biological “arms race,” each partner continuously adapts to the other to emerge alive. For reproductive success, parasitic wasps target their hosts’ behavior, development and immune system. Their attack mechanisms range from biochemical warfare and mimicry, to passive evasion and active immune suppression [ 1 – 3 ].  Drosophila  and their parasitic wasps are an emerging model for studying how wasps evade or suppress host defenses [ 4 , 5 ]. The generalist  Leptopilina heterotoma  ( Lh ) succeeds on the  Drosophila  species within and beyond the melanogaster group. Its close relative,  L .  boulardi  ( Lb ), considered a specialist, mainly infects flies of the melanogaster group. Both wasps are highly successful on  D .  melanogaster ; they consume its developing larval and pupal stages to emerge as free-living adults [ 6 ]. Oviposition into second-to-early-third  D .  melanogaster  larval hosts by  Lb  and  Lh  wasps yields divergent immunological effects.  Lb  infection activates many components of humoral and cellular immunity: Toll-NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the melanization pathways and their target genes are transcriptionally upregulated; there is a burst of hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation of blood cells (also called hemocytes) in the lymph gland and in circulation. If the immune responses are strong and sustained, macrophages and lamellocytes encapsulate and kill wasp eggs [ 7 – 11 ].  Lh  infection in contrast suppresses immune gene expression and kills immature and mature larval hemocytes [ 12 , 13 ]. Lb  and  Lh  females (and also  L .  victoriae , a sister species of  Lh ) produce discrete immune-suppressive extracellular vesicle- (EV) like structures in their venom glands (called multi-strategy extracellular vesicles, MSEVs in  Lh  and venosomes in  Lb ) [ 14 , 15 ]. Previously called virus like particles [ 16 – 18 ], these EVs lack clear viral features [ 15 , 19 ]. They are produced in the venom gland, a structure made up of the long gland and a reservoir. The secretory cells of the long gland synthesize and secrete proteins, some of which are initially incorporated into discrete non-spiked vesicle-like structures. In sister species  Lh  and  Lv , these structures mature in the reservoir and assume a stellate morphology with 4–8 spikes radiating from the center. Mature EVs are roughly 300 nm in diameter, [ 14 , 16 , 20 – 22 ]. Packed with more than 150 proteins, EVs are, in part, responsible for divergent physiological outcomes in infected hosts [ 15 , 19 , 23 ]. Among the most abundant in the  Lh  EV proteins is a 40 kDa surface/spike protein (SSp40) [ 20 ]. SSp40 shares structural similarities with the IpaD/SipD family of proteins of the gastroenteric disease-causing Gram negative bacteria,  Shigella  and  Salmonella  [ 15 ]. Similar to SSp40’s localization to  Lh  EV spike tips, IpaD localizes to the tips of the T3 secretion injectisome, a bacterial transfer system that injects virulence proteins into mammalian cells. IpaD itself promotes apoptosis of mammalian macrophages [ 24 , 25 ]. These parallels between  Lh  SSp40 and bacterial IpaD/SipD suggest that  Lh  EVs may share some similarities with bacterial secretion systems. Comparative transcriptomic/proteomic approaches revealed that SSp40 and a few other EV proteins are not expressed in the  Lb  venom [ 15 ]. Whereas  Lh  EVs lyse lamellocytes within a few hours of wasp attack,  Lb  EVs do not have the same effect [ 7 , 16 , 26 ]. Our immune-inhibition experiments suggested that  Lh ’s SSp40 mediates EV interactions with lamellocytes [ 20 ].  Lh  infection also uniquely promotes apoptosis of larval macrophages and of lymph gland hemocytes [ 13 ]. Macrophages make up more than 95% of all hematopoietic cells while differentiated lamellocytes are rarely found in naïve hosts [ 8 – 10 , 27 ]. Work in the field strongly suggests that the protein activities concentrated within the  Lh  EVs are responsible for the destruction of these mature and immature blood cells. However, how a macro-endoparasite targets the hematopoietic system and accesses its progenitor population has not been studied. The modes of  Lh  EV entry into these cells and the pathways of destruction are also not well understood. The goal of this study was to obtain a macro-level view of  Lh  EV interactions with cells of the larval hemolymphatic system after infection. The term hemolymph refers to the interstitial fluid that distributes hormones, peptides and other macromolecules into organs through the pumping action of an unbranched tubular heart, or the dorsal vessel. Dozens of macrophages circulate in the hemolymph. The heart lumen is surrounded by a column of paired cardiomyocytes and associated pericardial cells. This tubular structure is held in place by alary muscles [ 28 – 30 ]. Hematopoietic cells are organized in paired cell clusters (or lobes) on the dorsal vessel. In third instar larvae, the anterior-most lobes have blood cells at various stages of differentiation; the least differentiated progenitors are confined adjacent to the dorsal vessel, whereas the developing macrophages are sequestered in the cortical regions of the lobes ( Fig 1A ). In naïve hosts, the progenitor state is maintained by a putative niche (also called the posterior signaling center, PSC). The PSC is a tight unit of about 25–50 cells and is positioned posteriorly to the progenitors [ 31 , 32 ]. Upon  Lb  infection, the PSC reprograms hematopoiesis inducing macrophage and lamellocyte differentiation [ 30 , 32 – 39 ]. The entire structure is covered by the acellular basement membrane [ 28 , 40 ]. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009615.g001 Fig 1 Lh  EVs associate with the larval lymphatic system. ( A ) Anterior lobes (ALs, without lamellocytes) from a naïve  Antp>mCD8GFP Dome-MESO-GFP  ( AntpDMG ) animal shows medullary zone (MZ), cortical zone (CZ) and posterior signaling center (PSC). The lobes flank the dorsal vessel (DV, asterisk in other panels). ( B-D ) Anterior lobes from uninfected (UI;  B ),  Lb - and  Lh -infected ( C, D )  Antp>mCD8GFP  animals.  Lb17  infection induces lamellocyte differentiation in the cortex (lamellocytes are larger than their progenitors and are rich in F-actin). The GFP-positive PSC appears unaffected.  Lh14  attack leads to loss of lobe cells; the PSC cells are not tightly-clustered and displaced from their original location. ( E-K ) Lymph glands from  Pxn>GFP  animals. ( E ) GFP is expressed in the cortex of uninfected animals, but GFP expression is reduced after wasp attack ( F-H ).  Lh14 -infected ALs from the same infection experiment showing variability in loss of cells;  Lh  EVs (anti-SSp40 staining, referred to as p40 here and in remaining figures) are seen in some cells of these lobes and within the dorsal vessel. ( I-K ) Posterior lobes from uninfected ( I ) and  Lh -infected animals ( J, K ). ( L ) Circulating hemocytes from infected animals. Using  Drosophila  genetics, cell-specific markers and SSp40 staining as a proxy for  Lh  EV localization, we have pieced together a broad view of this host-parasite interaction interface. We show an abundance of  Lh  EVs in (a) the lumen of the larval dorsal vessel, (b) along the collagen/perlecan-based basement membrane around the dorsal vessel and surrounding clusters of lymph gland progenitors, and (c) inside the progenitor and mature macrophages. Moreover, high EV signal correlates with the disassembly of the cohesive PSC unit. PSC ablation limits EV internalization and loss of lymph gland hemocytes, while PSC inactivation via  hedgehog  ( hh ) knockdown (KD) does not have this effect. We also show that lymph gland hemocytes can phagocytose  Lh  EVs using the classical Rab5-mediated retrograde transport (RGT) pathway. Surprisingly, Rab5 also maintains fly macrophage identity, as  Rab5  KD leads to over-proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and tumorigenesis;  Rab5  function is cell-autonomous. Thus lymph glands are not merely a source of mature blood cells but are themselves immune competent organs and can clear the immune-suppressive  Lh  EVs to defend the host. However,  Lh  EVs proactively dislodge cells of the PSC, blocking differentiation of the protective immune cells.  Lh  EVs target the endomembrane system of macrophages that ultimately results in their apoptosis, thus highlighting central and previously unrecognized roles of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. These observations help explain why  Lh  infections target the larval lymph gland. The direct EV-macrophage interactions and cellular outcomes set the stage for future molecular analyses in both the hosts and parasites. Results Lh  EVs are present within the larval lymphatic system Lb17  attack triggers lamellocyte differentiation in the larval lymph gland cortex ( Fig 1A–1C ). At an equivalent time-point,  Lh -infected lobes are significantly smaller ( Fig 1D–1K ); [ 13 ]. Surprisingly, unlike  Antp>mCD8GFP -expressing PSCs of naïve and  Lb- infected lobes that remain tightly clustered ( Fig 1A–1C ), PSC cells of  Lh -infected hosts are dislodged and some are distributed in the body of the lobe ( Fig 1D ). To understand these responses, we imaged more than 25 hosts in multiple experiments. Throughout these studies, we used a polyclonal antibody to mark SSp40, an  Lh  EV-specific protein [ 20 ].  Lh  infection of  Pxn>GFP  animals reduced  Pxn>GFP  expression ( Fig 1E–1H ). ( Pxn  is normally active in the cortex and its expression mimics that of many other genes downregulated by  Lh  infection [ 7 ]). An abundance of  Lh  EVs was observed in anterior- and posterior-lobe hemocytes, in the dorsal vessel, and in circulating hemocytes ( Fig 1F–1H and 1J–1L ). This staining signal is absent in glands from naïve animals ( Fig 1E and 1I ). Thus,  Lb  and  Lh  attack have drastically different outcomes and  Lh  EVs appear to interact directly with most lymph gland hemocytes. In our analyses across experiments, we found that the degree of tissue loss and EV distribution varies. Lobe morphologies ranged from nearly intact and filled with EVs ( Fig 1F and 1J ) to damaged lobes, with few to many EVs ( Fig 1G, 1H and 1K ). This variation is likely due to (a) the duration of infection (i.e., time between oviposition and dissection); (b) the injected EV dose; or (c) the dynamics of EV circulation. Dissections at later time points showed loss of almost all lymph gland hemocytes [ 13 ]. To then probe how  Lh  EVs enter the lymphatic system, we stained  Lh -infected glands from fly strains with GFP-tagged Collagen IV (basement membrane,  Viking  [ 41 ]) or GFP-tagged proteoglycan core protein, Perlecan/Trol [ 42 ]. In both cases, EV puncta were clearly localized with the continuous GFP signals of these extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins along the dorsal vessel as well as in the interstitial spaces around clustered hematopoietic progenitors (yellow puncta in  Fig 2A–2D’  arrows). Surprisingly, punctate staining was also seen inside immature progenitors, adjacent to the dorsal vessel ( Fig 2B, 2B’ 2D and 2D’ ). EVs were also observed inside some cardiomyocytes as evidenced by SSp40 colocalization with the mCD8GFP signal in  HandΔ>mCD8GFP  larvae ( Fig 2E–2F’ , arrows). Thus,  Lh  EVs associate with ECM proteins of the lymphatic system, enter the dorsal vessel lumen and even some cardiomyocytes. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009615.g002 Fig 2 Lh  EVs associate with basement membrane proteins.

Effects of  Lh  infection on PSC integrity Previous studies have demonstrated that upon  Lb  infection, the PSC reprograms hematopoietic development and promotes lamellocyte differentiation. Similar to controls,  Lb  infected PSCs remain tightly clustered [ 35 , 37 , 38 , 43 , 44 ]. We found that regardless of the  Lh  strain, PSC cells dislodged from their normal posterior position into the body of the lobe (Figs  1D  and  S1A and S1B ). At the time points we examined, half of the PSC cells relocated into the lobe, of which an overwhelming majority (> 95%) were present as single cells or as groups of two cells. The other half remained in their original place, although some were not as tightly clustered (Figs  1D  and  S1 ; n = 24 PSCs from 12 lymph glands). As expected, in 14 lobes from naïve controls, all PSC cells were tightly packed. Strikingly, in samples from infected animals, where the PSCs were still intact, EVs congregated in regions adjacent to the PSC, but were never found inside the PSC cells ( S1A and S1B Fig ). The Slit ligand, originating from adjacent cardiomyocytes, controls PSC integrity via the Robo receptors in the PSC; Robo2 has the strongest effect [ 45 ]. Indeed, the effect of  Lh  infection on the PSC resembles  Slit/Robo2  KD, which promotes PSC disassembly [ 45 ] (Figs  1  and  S1 ). A cohesive PSC is important in hematopoietic development as fewer macrophages and crystal cells develop in  Slit / Robo2  KD lobes compared to controls. But differing from  Lh  infection,  Slit  KD PSCs are larger and there is no apparent loss of progenitors [ 45 ]. In spite of different outcomes in the two conditions, we hypothesized that the initial steps might be shared and that  Lh  EVs might inactivate the Slit-Robo signal, which might explain PSC disassembly. To test this idea, we infected animals in which the Slit-Robo pathway was manipulated to promote constitutive signaling. We found that neither expressing active Slit nor overexpressing Robo2 altered  Lh  EVs’ ability to disassemble the PSC.  Lh  infection of  HandΔ>Slit-N  animals still promoted PSC disassembly ( S2A–S2C’ Fig ; n = 16 lobes) even though gain-of-function  Slit-N  [ 46 ] reverses the effects of  Slit  KD [ 45 ]. Similarly,  Lh  infection bypassed the effects of Robo2 overexpression ( Antp>Robo2-HA ) and promoted PSC disassembly  S2D–S2F’ Fig ). Many EVs are observed around these PSCs ( S3 Fig ; n = 16). Thus, either EVs inactivate PSC function independently of the Slit-Robo signal, or they possess redundant mechanisms that disable constitutive Slit-Robo signaling. PSC-less lymph glands remain intact PSC-less lymph glands were unable to induce lamellocyte differentiation after  Lb  infection [ 36 ]. We asked if ablating the PSC might similarly inhibit the  Lh  infection responses. PSC-less lobes ( Col>Hid ) lacked Antp staining and  Lh14  infection did not affect lobe integrity ( S4A–S4 D’ Fig; n > 12 lobes). Moreover, while  Lh -infected  UAS-Hid  lobes lost progenitors and exhibited high levels of EV uptake ( Fig 3A, 3B, 3D and 3E ),  Lh -infected PSC-less lobes remained intact and showed low, non-specific SSp40 staining signal in anterior and posterior lobes ( Fig 3C and 3F ; n > 12 lobes for each condition). In contrast to the non-responsive  Col>Hid  lobes,  Antp>hh RNAi  lobes responded to  Lh  infection and suffered progenitor cell loss ( S5A–S5F Fig ; n > 12 lobes for each condition). Thus, inactivating the signaling function of the PSC does not appear to affect the wasp’s ability to disassemble the PSC. P1 staining revealed that  Lh  infection does not block macrophage differentiation ( S5C Fig ). Taken together, these results suggest that the PSC plays a structural role in trafficking of EVs from either the hemolymph or the dorsal vessel into the lobes and that the cell-lethal effects of  Lh  EVs is distinct from the PSC’s niche function. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009615.g003 Fig 3 PSC-less lymph glands from  Lh- infected animals have intact lobes. ( A, D ) Lobes from a naïve  UAS-Hid  host are intact and lack EVs; anterior ( A ), and posterior lobes ( D ). ( B, E ) Lymph gland from a  Lh -infected  UAS-Hid  host is depleted of hemocytes and has many EVs. Anterior lobes ( B, B’ ), and posterior lobes ( E, E’ ). ( C, F ) PSC-less lobes from a  Lh -infected  Col>Hid  host are intact with weak EV signal. Anterior ( C, C’ ), and posterior lobes ( F, F’ ). The larval lymph gland is phagocytically competent We next studied if EV uptake into hematopoietic cells occurs via RGT mechanisms. In  Pxn>GFP ;  +/Bc  heterozygous lymph glands, we observed blackened, dead crystal cells in the cytoplasm of the GFP-positive cortical cells ( S6 Fig ). This observation suggests that GFP-positive lymph gland cells are phagocytically competent. We therefore investigated if  Lh  EV uptake depends on Rab5, an early endosomal protein. Rab5 mediates trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes [ 47 ]. In contrast to  Pxn>GFP  macrophages, where EV staining is bright and punctate throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig 4A and 4B ),  Pxn>GFP ,  Rab5 RNAi  cells show peripheral punctate staining, presumably from intact EVs, trapped in early endosomes, both in lymph gland and circulating hemocytes ( Fig 4C and 4D ; arrows). In lamellocytes, the EV signal is diffuse and nuclear, and  Rab5  KD shows no change in staining intensity or distribution ( Fig 4E and 4F ; arrowheads), suggesting that Rab5-independent uptake mechanisms are involved.  msn-GFP - and integrin-β-positive lamellocyte fragments were also observed in  Lh -infected macrophages suggesting occurrence of efferocytosis ( S7 Fig ). 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009615.g004 Fig 4 Intracellular  Lh  EV localization.

As in  Fig 1 ,  Pxn>GFP  expression is reduced after wasp attack. Samples were counterstained with FITC-Phalloidin to visualize cell morphology. A larger Phalloidin-positive lamellocyte (arrowhead) remains EV negative, while smaller macrophages endocytose EVs. The EV signal is peripheral in some, but not all macrophages ( C, D ).

Lh  EVs negatively impact phagolysosomal organization in macrophages Rab7 mediates late endosome formation and trafficking between late endosomes and lysosomes is marked by Rab7 and LAMP1, respectively [ 47 ]. To evaluate if  Lh  EVs impact the RGT machinery, infected glands expressing GFP-tagged Rab5, Rab7, or LAMP1 proteins were examined ( Fig 5 ). Under our experimental conditions,  Lh  EVs rarely colocalized with early endosomes and Rab5 compartment morphology remained comparable to uninfected controls (only 14% of SSp40 puncta are Rab5-positive; n = 221 cells; 6 lobes;  Fig 5A–5C ). In contrast,  Lh  EVs were consistently found with GFP-Rab7 and GFP-LAMP1 and these compartments were grossly distorted (100% co-localization; n = 115 and 112 cells, Rab7 and LAMP, respectively, 6 lobes each;  Fig 5D–5E” ). Moreover, the Rab7/EV and LAMP1/EV signals were asymmetrically localized in  Lh -affected cells. In contrast,  Lb  infection did not distort LAMP-positive",

Hosts were allowed to recover after an 8–12 hr infection. Dissections were typically done one-to-two days after infection. Uninfected controls followed the same timeline. In general, longer infection regimes led to stronger responses: more lamellocytes differentiated after  Lb  infection and more lobe cells were lost after  Lh  infection. Under our experimental conditions, superparasitism by either wasp was rare and for our analyses, we avoided hosts with more than one parasite. Immunohistochemist",
  "results": "Results Lh  EVs are present within the larval lymphatic system Lb17  attack triggers lamellocyte differentiation in the larval lymph gland cortex ( Fig 1A–1C ). At an equivalent time-point,  Lh -infected lobes are significantly smaller ( Fig 1D–1K ); [ 13 ]. Surprisingly, unlike  Antp>mCD8GFP -expressing PSCs of naïve and  Lb- infected lobes that remain tightly clustered ( Fig 1A–1C ), PSC cells of  Lh -infected hosts are dislodged and some are distributed in the body of the lobe ( Fig 1D ). To understand these responses, we imaged more than 25 hosts in multiple experiments. Throughout these studies, we used a polyclonal antibody to mark SSp40, an  Lh  EV-specific protein [ 20 ].  Lh  infection of  Pxn>GFP  animals reduced  Pxn>GFP  expression ( Fig 1E–1H ). ( Pxn  is normally active in the cortex and its expression mimics that of many other genes downregulated by  Lh  infection [ 7 ]). An abundance of  Lh  EVs was observed in anterior- and posterior-lobe hemocytes, in the dorsal vessel, and in circulating hemocytes ( Fig 1F–1H and 1J–1L ). This staining signal is absent in glands from naïve animals ( Fig 1E and 1I ). Thus,  Lb  and  Lh  attack have drastically different outcomes and  Lh  EVs appear to interact directly with most lymph gland hemocytes. In our analyses across experiments, we found that the degree of tissue loss and EV distribution varies. Lobe morphologies ranged from nearly intact and filled with EVs ( Fig 1F and 1J ) to damaged lobes, with few to many EVs ( Fig 1G, 1H and 1K ). This variation is likely due to (a) the duration of infection (i.e., time between oviposition and dissection); (b) the injected EV dose; or (c) the dynamics of EV circulation. Dissections at later time points showed loss of almost all lymph gland hemocytes [ 13 ]. To then probe how  Lh  EVs enter the lymphatic system, we stained  Lh -infected glands from fly strains with GFP-tagged Collagen IV (basement membrane,  Viking  [ 41 ]) or GFP-tagged proteoglycan core protein, Perlecan/Trol [ 42 ]. In both cases, EV puncta were clearly localized with the continuous GFP signals of these extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins along the dorsal vessel as well as in the interstitial spaces around clustered hematopoietic progenitors (yellow puncta in  Fig 2A–2D’  arrows). Surprisingly, punctate staining was also seen inside immature progenitors, adjacent to the dorsal vessel ( Fig 2B, 2B’ 2D and 2D’ ). EVs were also observed inside some cardiomyocytes as evidenced by SSp40 colocalization with the mCD8GFP signal in  HandΔ>mCD8GFP  larvae ( Fig 2E–2F’ , arrows). Thus,  Lh  EVs associate with ECM proteins of the lymphatic system, enter the dorsal vessel lumen and even some cardiomyocytes. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009615.g002 Fig 2 Lh  EVs associate with basement membrane proteins.

Effects of  Lh  infection on PSC integrity Previous studies have demonstrated that upon  Lb  infection, the PSC reprograms hematopoietic development and promotes lamellocyte differentiation. Similar to controls,  Lb  infected PSCs remain tightly clustered [ 35 , 37 , 38 , 43 , 44 ]. We found that regardless of the  Lh  strain, PSC cells dislodged from their normal posterior position into the body of the lobe (Figs  1D  and  S1A and S1B ). At the time points w",
  "discussion": "Discussion System-wide distribution but specific effects of  Lh  EVs Parasitism by  L .  heterotoma  has been of interest because of its ability to parasitize many  Drosophila  hosts and the existence of venom factors that kill host hemocytes.  Lb  lacks these activities ( Fig 7 ). The discovery of an anti-lamellocyte activity intrinsic to  Lh  EVs provided initial insights into the critical roles of these EVs in parasitism [ 20 , 49 ]. However, details underlying their apoptotic effects on macrophages have been lacking. This work provides the first view into how  Lh  EVs rely on the host’s circulation to gain system-wide distribution to not only precisely kill the available effector cells but also to pre-emptively interfere with the host’s ability to produce additional effector cells. We show that lymph glands serve an important, previously unappreciated role in immunity. A majority of lymph gland cells can phagocytose  Lh  EVs to protect the host from their detrimental effects. EV activities in turn promote their apoptotic death by disrupting their endomembrane system. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009615.g007 Fig 7 Lh  EV interactions and effects on host blood cells: summary of events. Left: Immune suppression by  Lh  and  Lb  wasps and host defense in response to infection. Text in bold indicates findings from this study. Right:  Lb  attack triggers NF-κB-dependent signaling events in the PSC and promotes lamellocyte differentiation of lymph gland progenitors (left lobe). This process is important in host defense against parasitic wasps [ 35 , 44 ] and is kept in check by Rab5. After  Lh  infection (right lobe),  Lh  MSEVs concentrate around and disassemble the PSC. They are phagocytosed by macrophages by a Rab5-dependent endocytic mechanism. In macrophages, EVs damage the phagolysosomal compartments. They are internalized by lamellocytes independently of Rab5 function. EVs lyse the few lamellocytes that differentiate post infection. This work also lays bare new questions.  Lh  EVs’ association with the ECM proteins around the lymphatic system cells suggests ways in which EVs might recognize and home into the lymph gland hemocytes and cardiomyocytes although the role of the ECM, the details of their entry and physiological effects on cardiomyocytes are currently unclear. As has been suggested for Slit-carrying vesicles [ 45 ], cardiac cells might provide a route for  Lh  EVs to converge into the vicinity of the PSCs. Once inside lymph gland hemoctytes, they simultaneously target the protective functions of macrophages and lamellocytes and their activities culminate to strongly block encapsulation ( Fig 7 ). These strategies are not uncommon and are likely to be shared by closely related  Leptopilina  wasps or even unrelated virulent wasps that attack drosophilid and non-drosophilid hosts and are known to destroy their hosts’ hematopoietic cells [ 50 – 54 ]. Lh  EVs proactively block encapsulation Studies with  Lb  showed that the lymph gland itself r",
