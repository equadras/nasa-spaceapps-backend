  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION Fusarium oxysporum  is a presumed asexual, filamentous fungus ubiquitous in soil and infamous for causing vascular wilt and root rot disease in many economically important plants and crops ( 1 ). While the number of hosts this species can infect is extensive (tomatoes, bananas, cotton, strawberries, eggplants, tulips, soybean, beets, and chrysanthemum, to name only a few) ( 2 ), individual isolates show a high degree of host specificity and are assigned to  formae speciales  (f. sp.) based on the host it can infect ( 3 ). For example,  F. oxysporum  f. sp.  cubense  causes fungal wilt in bananas (“Panama disease”) while f. sp.  melonis , f. sp.  tulipae,  and f. sp.  cucumerimum  infect and cause disease in melons, tulips, and cucumbers, respectively. At present, there are approximately 150  formae speciales  (i.e., host-specific groups of strains) that have been described ( 2 ). While well known as a phytopathogen,  F. oxysporum  can also cause infections in humans, ranging from superficial and localized (skin, nail, cornea, and superficial wound) in immunocompetent individuals to invasive and disseminated (blood culture, deep tissue involvement, or isolation of strain from two or more body sites) in immunocompromised patients ( 4 – 6 ). Since members of the fungal genus  Fusarium  are intrinsically resistant to most available antifungals on the market ( 7 ), prognosis is often poor and sometimes fatal for those afflicted with systemic fusariosis ( 6 ,  8 ). Fungi are known to produce many bioactive molecules that can benefit humans, such as antimicrobials, antialgals, immunosuppressants, compounds cytotoxic to cancer cells, insecticides, and antioxidants ( 9 – 11 ), and  F. oxysporum  is no exception.  F. oxysporum  isolated from the plants  Smallanthus sonchifolius  and  Catharanthus roseus  were shown to produce, in appreciable amounts, the anticancer drugs anhydrofusarubin and beauvericin ( 12 ) and vinblastine and vincristine ( 13 ), respectively. An isolate of  F. oxysporum  cultured from  Juniperus recurva  was shown to produce the aryltetralin lignin podophyllotoxin ( 14 ), which is a precursor for the chemical synthesis of anticancer drugs like etoposide, teniposide, and etopophose ( 15 ,  16 ). Podophyllotoxin is also known for its antiviral ( 17 ) and antiparasitic ( 18 ) activity. In an ongoing microbial tracking study of the International Space Station (ISS), two  F. oxysporum  isolates were cultured from the dining table in the U.S. module of the ISS. The genomes of these two isolates were sequenced and compared to 65 other  F. oxysporum  isolates. The predicted proteins were annotated and mined for the presence of secondary metabolites and putative virulence factors. The virulence of these isolates in an immunocompromised (MAPKK-deficient)  Caenorhabditis elegans  model of invasive fusariosis was also assessed. This is the first study to isolate and characterize  F. oxysporum  isolates from a built environment as well as one that has been exposed to space. RESULTS Two  F. oxysporum  isolates (designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4) were cultured from the dining table of the U.S. module of the ISS. The genomes were paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size, resulting in 48 million (ISS-F3) and 42 million (ISS-F4) reads. These paired-end reads were  de novo  assembled into scaffolds (k-mer size = 86) using ABySS (version 2.0.2) ( 19 ). The assembled genome size for ISS-F3 was 53.6 Mb and for ISS-F4 was 53.8 Mb, which is comparable to the genome size of the model strain,  F. oxysporum  f. sp.  lycopersici  strain 4287 (59.9 Mb) ( 20 ).  Table 1  provides general assembly statistics of the draft genomes of  F. oxysporum  ISS-F3 and ISS-F4.

The conserved marker gene translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) was used to determine the phylogenetic relatedness of ISS-F3/F4 to 62 other  F. oxysporum  strains, belonging to various  formae speciales,  and seven strains belonging to other  Fusarium  species included as outgroups, based on clonal (asexual) vertical inheritance. EF-1α allows for phylogenetic species recognition because it is applicable across  Fusarium  and it is informative at or near the species level and orthologous across the genus ( 21 ). Based on EF-1α phylotyping,  F. oxysporum  can be divided into 3 distinct clades with various clonal lineages within each clade ( 22 ,  23 ). The phylogenetic tree inferred in  Fig. 1A  clusters ISS-F3/F4 into clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage closely related to 4 other strains: three members of  F. oxysporum  f. sp.  lycopersici  and the non-plant-pathogenic biocontrol strain Fo47 (members of a clonal lineage have the same sequence of conserved genes). Three other isolates of interest are highlighted in  Fig. 1A  because they too had been isolated from harsh environments, two cultured from ISS-grown  Zinnia hybrida  plants that caused foliar, stem, and root rot (VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2), and IMV00293, cultured at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 12 years after the explosion. The ISS  Z. hybrida  strains fell into a different branch from ISS-F3/F4 and were most closely related to IMV00293. FIG 1 Phylogenetic relationship of ISS-F3/F4 among other  F. oxysporum  isolates. (A) The phylogenetic tree constructed from EF-1α sequences of 62  F. oxysporum  isolates places ISS-F3/F4 in clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage shared by lycopersici_016, lycopersici_072, lycopersici_075, and Fo47. Other  Fusarium  species (bottom) were included to root the tree. The bootstrap confidence (in percent; 1,000 replicates performed) is shown in red numbers in the tree. (B) Presence/absence profiles of ISS-F3/F4 with 62 other strains based on 104 candidate effector proteins. Colored boxes indicate the presence of a particular effector gene, with gray indicating its absence in the genome. The list of effector genes is shown in  Data Set S4 .  Formae speciales  that cause disease in the same host cluster together, as seen by the groupings of green (cucurbit-infecting strains), red (tomato-infecting strains), and yellow (banana-infecting strains). Dark gray represents non-plant-pathogenic isolates, and pink represents strains isolated from or flown to the ISS. Blue represents other plant pathogens. ISS-F3/F4 contained relatively few effector genes compared to the number found in the plant pathogens (green, red, yellow, and blue) and showed the most similar pattern (number and type) to Fo47, a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate with a biocontrol function. F. oxysporum  genomes consist of a “core” set of housekeeping genes and an “accessory” genome which is not required for vegetative growth but contains most of, if not all, the genes that allow the fungus to invade and cause disease in a host plant ( 20 ). Utilizing 104 effector candidates, van Dam et al. were able to show that strains infecting the same host generally possess a similar set of effectors and that these effectors are often identical within a  forma specialis  ( 24 ). This indicates that the accessory genome, specifically the effector genes residing in these regions, can be used to identify  formae speciales  within the  F. oxysporum  species complex (FOSC), including newly encountered strains ( 24 ).  Figure 1B  shows the hierarchical clustering of presence/absence patterns of 104 effector sequences in ISS-F3/F4 along with 62 other strains. The effector profile of ISS-F3/F4 was the most similar to Fo47 (a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate that has been shown to exert a biocontrol function) ( 25 ) with similarities to another non-plant-pathogenic isolate, MN25, and CL57 (NRRL 26381), an isolate causing root rot in tomato, also known as NRRL 26381. The ISS-F3/F4 strains do not contain as many effector genes as (almost) all of the plant pathogens examined and do not possess any of the SIX genes (see top panel of  Fig. 1B ), which encode secreted fungal proteins that were first discovered in the xylem sap of infected tomato plants and have a well-studied role in plant pathogenesis ( 26 ,  27 ). Relationship between ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. Further analyses were conducted to determine how closely related ISS-F3 and ISS-F4 were to each other. The sequences of 10 phylogenetically informative loci ( 28 ) were compared between the two strains, and for all 10 loci, the sequences were identical between ISS-F3/F4. Second, a BLAST comparison was performed using contigs above 2 kb for each strain. Using ISS-F3 as the query, each of the 682 contigs matched a contig in ISS-F4 with either 99% or 100% identity with an E value of 0. Last, when single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed against the reference genome Fo47, ISS-F3/F4 had the same single nucleotide variants. For this reason, it is believed that ISS-F3/F4 are clonal derivatives of each other. Strain identification. Based on EF-1α phylogeny ( Fig. 1A ) and the presence/absence of effector proteins ( Fig. 1B ), ISS-F3/F4 appeared to be the most closely related to Fo47. To determine whether the ISS strains were Fo47 or represented a distinct strain, two  in silico  genomic comparisons were conducted. (i) k-mer comparison. The KMC2 k-mer counter ( 29 ) was used to generate 50-bp long k-mers from 65  F. oxysporum  genomes that were downloaded from GenBank (see Table S1 in  Data Set S5  in the supplemental material). The k-mers generated from each genome were compared against the k-mers from all other genomes to find the ones that were specific to each of the 65 genomes analyzed. From all genome-specific k-mers that were identified, a subset was chosen from each genome to create the  F. oxysporum  k-mer database. These sequences were chosen based on number of occurrences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome) and the type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good balance of GC and AT ratios). The sequences making up this database are listed in  Table S2 . 10.1128/mSystems.00345-18.5 TABLE S2 F. oxysporum  k-mer database. The sequences shown represent the 50-bp k-mer sequences that are unique to each strain and not present in the other 64 strains examined. Download  Table S2, TXT file, 0.05 MB .

The assembled genomes of ISS-F3/F4 were then compared using BLAST against the  F. oxysporum  k-mer database, and for ISS-F3/F4 to be considered one of the 65  F. oxysporum  strains, every k-mer in the database belonging to a specific strain had to have a perfect match in the genome. For example, all k-mers generated for strain Fo47 in the database needed to match sequences in either the ISS-F3 or -F4 genome 100% (i.e., 50-bp k-mer/50-bp genome [no mismatches]) for ISS-F3 or -F4 to be considered Fo47. None of the Fo47 unique k-mer sequences matched sequences in the ISS-F3 or ISS-F4 genome, and only 1 k-mer from strains  radicis-lycopersici  26381 (CL57), UASWS AC1,  lycopersici  Fol074, and  melonis  Fom009 found an exact match. Based on the criteria above, ISS-F3/F4 were not the same strain as Fo47 nor any of the other 64 strains tested. (ii) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. SNP genotyping was the second  in silico  comparative method used to determine the relatedness of the ISS isolates to that of Fo47. Using Fo47 as the reference genome, the number of SNPs in the genomes of ISS-F3/F4 compared to Fo47 was calculated, along with other strains as a comparison. These additional strains are listed in Table S3 in  Data Set S5 , along with the reasons for choosing them. Phylogenies of these isolates inferred using maximum likelihood from SNP sequences in coding regions across every genome indicate that they are distinct from Fo47 and the other strains included ( Fig. 2A ). Similar results were obtained with SNPs across the entire genome (coding and noncoding regions) (data not shown). A summary of the total number of SNPs across the genome, the number of SNPs in coding regions, and the number of SNPs in noncoding regions is displayed in  Fig. 2B . The total numbers of SNPs in ISS-F3/F4 were 150,000 and 152,000, which are more than  lycopersici  Fol016 and  radicis-lycopersici  26381 (also known as CL57), which are well-defined, characterized strains, known to be different than Fo47. FIG 2 Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis comparing ISS-F3/F4 to the reference genome Fo47. (A) Maximum likelihood tree constructed from SNPs found in the coding regions of the genomes of ISS-F3, ISS-F4, and 8 other  F. oxysporum  strains (see Table S3 in  Data Set S5  for reasons for inclusion in analysis). ISS-F3/F4 form their own clonal lineage distinct from Fo47 and the other strains. A similar tree was inferred when all SNPs across the genome were analyzed. (B) The frequency of SNPs across the entire genome (black), the noncoding region of the genome (purple), and the coding region of the genome (yellow) is summarized in the bar graph. Fol016 and 26381, well-defined strains, known to be different than Fo47, had a lower frequency of SNPs than ISS-F3/F4. Annotation of ISS-F3/F4 genes. Using the gene prediction program AUGUSTUS ( 30 ), ISS-F3 was predicted to contain 16,648 genes and ISS-F4 had 16,729 genes. This number is very close to the predicted number of genes (17,735) for the model strain,  F. oxysporum  f. sp.  lycopersici  4287 ( 20 ,  31 ). The predicted genes were annotated with BLAST2GO, and 47% of the genes in ISS-F3 and 56% in ISS-F4 could be matched to known proteins while the remaining genes were listed as hypothetical ( Data Sets S1  and  S2 ). Among the predicted genes, 273 genes in ISS-F3 and 76 genes in ISS-F4 had no similarity to fungal genes in the NCBI database ( Data Sets S1  and  S2 ) and could possibly represent novel, unidentified fungal proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation was also performed with BLAST2GO, and 65% of the predicted genes in ISS-F3 and 68% in ISS-F4 could be assigned a function ( Data Sets S1  and  S2 ). The most frequently represented GO functional assignments were metabolic and cellular processes (category: biological processes), catalytic activity and binding (category: metabolic function), and membrane and membrane part components (category: cellular component) ( Fig. 3A ). A summary of the 50 most abundant GO terms in each of the 3 categories mentioned above is presented in  Fig. S1 . Approximately 15% of the predicted genes were classified as enzymes, with hydrolases dominating followed by transferases ( Fig. 3B ). FIG 3 Summary of gene ontology (GO) annotation of the predicted genes in ISS-F3/F4. Predicted genes in ISS-F3/F4 were predicted using AUGUSTUS and then annotated using Blast2GO. Functions could be assigned to 10,789 of the 16,648 genes in ISS-F3 and 11,305 of the 16,729 genes in ISS-F4. (A) Bar charts summarizing the most abundant GO terms for ISS-F3. BP, biological processes; MF, metabolic function; CC, cellular components. (B) Bar charts summarizing the abundance of enzyme classes in ISS-F3. NB, ISS-F3/F4 had the same distributions of GO and enzyme class abundances, and thus, only ISS-F3 is shown for simplicity. The distributions in ISS-F3/F4 were similar to Fo47 (non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate) and FOSC-3a (clinical isolate) (data not shown). 10.1128/mSystems.00345-18.1 FIG S1 GO annotation of  F. oxysporum  ISS-F3/F4 strains.

Protein families were classified and domains predicted with InterProScan, and 91% of the predicted proteins in ISS-F3/F4 could be assigned a function. Abundant protein domains in ISS-F3/F4 were the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) domain, the Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain, the fungal transcription factor domain, the ankyrin repeat-containing domain, and the protein kinase domain ( Fig. 4A ). The abundant protein families were the NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily, MFS transporter superfamily, P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain superfamily, and the alpha/beta hydrolase fold ( Fig. 4B ). A comparison was performed between the ISS strains isolated during this study and a non-plant-pathogenic biocontrol soil isolate (Fo47) and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). While the most abundant domains and families in ISS-F3/F4 were also the most abundant ones in Fo47 and FOSC-3a, the collective proportions differed, with Fo47 and FOSC-3a more similar to each other than to ISS-F3/F4 ( Fig. 4 ). There were also many domains and families that were present in Fo47 and FOSC-3a that were not found in the ISS-F3/F4 genomes and vice versa ( Fig. S2 ).  Data Set S3  shows the full list of protein domains and families present in each of the different strains and the relative abundances of each within each genome. FIG 4 Annotation of protein domains and protein families with InterProScan. Protein families were classified and domains were predicted using InterProScan. The heat map shows the relative abundances of the top 100 most abundant domains (A) and families (B) in ISS-F3/F4, in addition to a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate (Fo47) and a clinical isolate, isolated from a patient with fusariosis (FOSC-3a). Red represents high relative abundances, and green represents low relative abundances. 10.1128/mSystems.00345-18.2 FIG S2 Annotation of protein domains and protein families with InterProScan.

  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of fungal strains. Surfaces (1 m 2 ) were sampled on the ISS using premoistened 9-in. by 9-in. polyester wipes (ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) that were prepared as part of an ongoing microbial tracking study during flight sampling 3 (6 May 2016). Wipes were stored at room temperature (RT) before being brought back to Earth, 6 days after sampling, where they were processed as described previously ( 63 ). Material from the wipes was plated, 100 μl, on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with chloramphenicol (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) and incubated at 25°C for 7 days.  Fusarium oxysporum , identified by morphology and ITS region sequencing, was isolated from the ISS dining table. The two isolates were designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. Whole-genome sequencing. (i) Genomic DNA extraction. Freezer stocks of ISS-F3/F4 were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25°C for 5 days, at which time the entire plate was covered with fungal growth. The growth over the entire plate was scraped into a sterile mortar and pestle containing a small amount of liquid nitrogen. The colonies were ground into a powder and then transferred into PowerBead tubes from the MoBio PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, USA; catalog number 12888), and the extraction protocol was followed per the manufacturer’s instructions, except for the last step, in which DNA was eluted in 80 μl of solution C6 (i.e., elution buffer). DNA was stored at −20°C until sent for sequencing. (ii) Sequencing and assembly. Genomic DNA was paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) with a 350-bp insert size on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by Macrogen (Rockville, MD, USA). Totals of 48 million reads for F3 and 42 million reads for F4 were generated. Trimmomatic on the Galaxy server ( https://usegalaxy.org ) was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings: maximum mismatch, 2; accuracy of the match between the two adaptor-ligated reads, 30; accuracy of the match between any adaptor, 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings: minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads were  de novo  assembled using ABySS version 2.0.2 ( 19 ) using the default settings. Different k-mer sizes ranging from 68 to 90 were tested in order to find the one that gave the highest  N 50  score and lowest number of scaffolds/contigs, after assembly. The k-mer size 86 gave the best results for both F3 and F4, and the resulting assemblies were used for downstream analyses. Phylogenetic analysis. The phylogeny of the newly identified strains was assessed by extracting the full-length gene sequence of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) from each of the genomes using BLASTN. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters ( 64 ), and phylogeny was inferred with PhyML ( 65 ) (1,000 bootstraps; percent bootstrap confidence is shown in red numbers in the tree). The trees were visualized using ETE 3 ( 66 ). The effector clustering",

Three other isolates of interest are highlighted in  Fig. 1A  because they too had been isolated from harsh environments, two cultured from ISS-grown  Zinnia hybrida  plants that caused foliar, stem, and root rot (VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2), and IMV00293, cultured at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 12 years after the explosion. The ISS  Z. hybrida  strains fell into a different branch from ISS-F3/F4 and were most closely related to IMV00293. FIG 1 Phylogenetic relationship of ISS-F3/F4 among other  F. oxysporum  isolates. (A) The phylogenetic tree constructed from EF-1α sequences of 62  F. oxysporum  isolates places ISS-F3/F4 in clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage shared by lycopersici_016, lycopersici_072, lycopersici_075, and Fo47. Other  Fusarium  species (bottom) were included to root the tree. The bootstrap confidence (in percent; 1,000 replicates performed) is shown in red numbers in the tree. (B) Presence/absence profiles of ISS-F3/F4 with 62 other strains based on 104 candidate effector proteins. Colored boxes indicate the presence of a particular effector gene, with gray indicating its absence in the genome. The list of effector genes is shown in  Data Set S4 .  Formae speciales  that cause disease in the same host cluster together, as seen by the groupings of green (cucurbit-infecting strains), red (tomato-infecting strains), and yellow (banana-infecting strains). Dark gray represents non-plant-pathogenic isolates, and pink represents strains isolated from or flown to the ISS. Blue represents other plant pathogens. ISS-F3/F4 contained relatively few effector genes compared to the number found in the plant pathogens (green, red, yellow, and blue) and showed the most similar pattern (number and type) to Fo47, a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate with a biocontrol function.

  "discussion": "DISCUSSION This study presents the genomic analysis of two  F. oxysporum  isolates, cultured from the ISS, during an ongoing microbial tracking study. The phylogenetic placement of these two strains based on EF-1α nucleotide sequence and whole-genome SNPs shows that they are within the genetic variation of terrestrial strains and that their ability to thrive in the space environment was not contingent on enhanced genetic variation. F. oxysporum  strains are well known for their plant pathogenicity, and for successful infection of its plant host, effector proteins are secreted from the fungus that aid in the colonization process. Performing disease assays to determine host specificity is both laborious and time-consuming; however, a recent molecular screening method based on 104 effector proteins was developed by van Dam et al. which can predict host specificity in  F. oxysporum  ( 24 ). The presence/absence of these effector proteins in ISS-F3/F4 was determined and compared to 62 other strains from a variety of  formae speciales . The ISS strains contained relatively few candidate effector genes compared to phytopathogens, with numbers similar to that detected in two non-plant-pathogenic strains, Fo47 and MN14. The ISS isolates also did not contain any of the 14  s ecreted  i n  x ylem (SIX) effector genes, which encode cysteine-rich secreted proteins that appear to manipulate host defenses to promote infection ( 38 ). Based on the effector content, it is unlikely that ISS-F3/F4 are plant pathogens. VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2, isolated from  Z. hybrida  plants grown on the ISS and whole-genome sequences ( 39 ) also displayed relatively few effector genes ( Fig. 1B ) and were unable to infect healthy  Z. hybrida  plants (G. Massa, personal communication). Based on effector content and EF-1α phylogeny, ISS-F3/F4 appeared to be the most closely related to Fo47, a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate known for its biocontrol properties. Based on the number of SNPs across the genome, the phylogeny inferred using maximum likelihood from SNP sequences in both coding and noncoding regions, and the k-mer analysis, ISS-F3/F4 were not Fo47 or identical to any of the 65 strains compared in this study. Thus, it appears that these ISS isolates represent a genomically unique strain, which has not yet been identified and characterized to date. The ISS is a hermetically sealed system, closed off from its surrounding environment, with microbial introduction being of terrestrial origin from astronauts and payloads. ISS-F3/F4 were most likely introduced in the same fashion, so it begs the question why they had been identified only on the ISS and not on Earth, where 150  formae speciales  have already been characterized ( 2 ). One hypothesis is that ISS-F3/F4 are present in relatively low abundances on Earth but were selected because of their ability to withstand ISS-associated environmental pressures such as increased radiation, which compared to terrestrial indoor building",
