  "abstract": "Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Mitigating the adverse effects of spaceflight requires a better mechanistic understanding of the profound challenges that are imposed upon astronauts, including the upcoming missions to Mars and the moon. Extended spaceflight missions that travel beyond the cocoon of the Earth’s magnetosphere subject astronauts to microgravity and outer space radiation. Risks inherent to the mechanical unloading of microgravity include degeneration of musculoskeletal tissue and the cardiovascular system. The microgravity of spaceflight indeed causes substantial wasting of skeletal muscle and weakness 1 – 4 . Mounting evidence indicates that altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading-induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue 4 – 8 . Therefore, the identification of mechanosensing pathways during the unloading of spaceflight, and thus the effect on musculoskeletal morphology and contractile function, continues as one of NASA’s long-term mission objectives. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that drive body movement, protect joints and bones, serve as the primary glucose sink, and are central to systemic energy metabolism. Skeletal muscles adapt readily to changes in various stimuli, including changes in loading 9 , 10 . Indeed, skeletal muscles remodel their morphology in response to changes in the mechanical, nutrient, and energy-sensing environments 11 – 15 . Load-bearing skeletal muscles adapt to changes in the mechanical environment, allowing mature muscle fibers to hypertrophy in response to increased loading and atrophy when presented with decreased loading. For example, when humans participate in resistance exercise, skeletal muscles can undergo increased mass through hypertrophy of muscle fibers 16 , 17 . In response to mechanical unloading that occurs during the microgravity of spaceflight, chronic bedrest, or casting, skeletal muscles adapt rapidly by degrading contractile protein into constitutive amino acids, suppressing protein synthesis, and thus reducing muscle fiber cross-sectional area 4 , 6 . A common teleological argument for skeletal muscle atrophy as a biological response to unloading is that extreme disuse would accompany a significant injury or disease, both of which require an increased demand for amino acids and protein 18 – 20 . However, the skeletal muscle wasting or atrophy that occurs with microgravity 21 , disuse 22 , cancer 23 , and aging 24  compromises physical function and systemic health. Rotating wall vessel bioreactors are frequently utilized in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate spaceflight microgravity conditions 25 – 27 . These bioreactors produce a low-shear, three-dimensional culture environment that mimics certain aspects of weightlessness 27 . However, they are not suitable for inducing tensile mechanical loading in skeletal muscle fibers experience during exercise in spaceflight. Although tumbler bioreactors create a low-shear environment through rotation, they largely produce compression rather than tension on skeletal muscle fibers. Therefore, tumbler or centrifugal fail to accurately reproduce the changes in tensile mechanical forces encountered by skeletal muscles during weightlessness and exercise. Skeletal muscles produce and transfer tensile loads to attached tendons and bones by two mechanisms: (1) in series through muscle fibers and (2) in parallel through transverse loading of z-discs and linked costamere interaction with surrounding layers of connective tissue (e.g., endomysium, perimysium) 28 . Skeletal muscles are organized as multinucleated myofibers, whose function is to generate length and velocity-dependent forces for movement and stability. Skeletal muscle contractions and outside resistance produce net tension down a skeletal muscle’s long axis. Indeed, skeletal muscles respond to dyanamic alterations in mechanical loading by adapting muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area 29 , 30 , and shifting the % of slow-twitch fibers 31 , 32 . Unloading induced skeletal muscle atrophy is believed to be a function of both elevated protein degradation coupled with decreased protein anabolism 8 . In addition, there is an increase in connective tissue in unloaded skeletal muscle as well 33 . Thus, maintaining mechanical loading, such as tension and stretch, is crucial for muscle health and function. Therefore, the development of a bioreactor for experimental use of skeletal muscle cells (i.e., myotubes) to simulate spaceflight or exercise during spaceflight should impose similar uniaxial tensile loading or stretch, that cannot be currently reproduced with rotating wall vessels bioreactors. Ergo, to study the physiological responses of skeletal muscle fibers to tensile loading, myoblasts were seeded and differentiated into myotubes on an laminin-coated elastic membrane, which was then stretched to observe the cellular responses 34 . Based upon our findings we propose a microgravity bioreactor for the cellular stretch that is an analog of the FlexCell® system, which uses a vacuum instead to stretch the silastic membrane, eliciting radial loading 35 . Instead, we employed a StrexCell® system fitted that includes a stepper motor to produce true uniaxial, cyclic stretch while eliciting tensile loading on myoblasts or myotubes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use cyclic stretch and cessation protocols with the StrexCell system on skeletal muscle myotubes 36 , 37  as a potential bioreactor for microgravity and re-entry into gravitational environments. Results Myotube morphology in response to cyclic stretch, cessation of daily stretch To study the effects of cyclic stretch and cessation of stretch on skeletal muscle myotube morphology and size, we used C2C12 mouse lineage myoblasts to generate myotubes, and mounted on laminin.  β -sarcoglycan immunofluorescence positive staining was used as a membrane marker to calculate the myotube diameter as a marker of hypertrophy and atrophy (Fig.  1 ). Confocal immunofluorescence quantification revealed a significant increase of 51% and 94% in mean myotube diameter following 2 and 5 days of a cyclic stretch, compared to the 2-day and 5-day quiescent controls, respectively (Fig.  1b ). When myotubes underwent three days without cyclic stretch in myotubes, following 2 days of cyclic stretch, then myotube diameter was 32% lower compared to the loaded, stretched myotubes (Fig.  1b ). Quantification of the total nuclei population per field revealed a significant reduction as a result of 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching compared to the controls (Fig.  1c ), indicating an increase in fiber size while the nuclear number was relatively static. The fusion index was found to be increased significantly by the 2, and 5 days stretching protocol compared with quiescent controls (Fig.  1d ). However, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT), did not alter the fusion index compared to the 2 days cyclic stretching.

Myotubes were divided into the following groups ( n  = 4/group): 2 days quiescent control (no stretch (2d), 5 days quiescent control (no stretch (5d), 2 days cyclic stretch (2dHY), 5 days cyclic stretch (5dHY), and 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT).

The median of the data is indicated by the central line. Functional protein turnover marker with cyclic stretching and cessation of stretch We then determined the effects of (1) uniaxial cyclic stretching and (2) release from or cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch on markers of protein synthesis and proteolysis commonly used in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy studies 35 , 38 , 39 . Protein abundance of the focal adhesion complex and cytoskeletal protein talin was chosen as a muscle hypertrophy marker, while the activity of calpains was chosen as a proteolytic marker (Fig.  2 ). Our findings revealed that both 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching significantly elevated the levels of talin protein compared to the control levels (Fig.  2a ). There was no statistically significant difference between 2 and 5 days of stretch on talin protein levels.

Protein abundance quantification was determined using Western immunoblotting with Ponceau stain as a protein loading control and quantified using ImageJ for talin.  b  Calpain Activity is expressed as fluorogenic values (RFU/mg/min). Myotubes were divided into the following groups ( n  = 4/group): 2 days quiescent control (no stretch (2d), 2 days cyclic stretch (2dHY), 5 days cyclic stretch (5dHY), and 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). ( a ) = statistically significant difference from no-stretch (2d); ( b ) = significantly different than 2dHY; ( c ) = significantly different than 5dHY. ( p  ≤ 0.05) Values are presented as Box plots ±SD. The boxplots illustrate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentiles) displayed with whiskers spanning from the 10th to the 90th percentiles. The median of the data is indicated by the central line. However, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT) resulted in a significantly lower level of talin than 2 and 5 days of daily cyclic stretch. Talin protein levels were not statistically different from quiescent myotubes that experienced no daily stress and strain due to stretch. In contrast, calpain activity that was measured by fluorescence revealed a significant increase in activity in the 2dHY and 5dHY groups, indicating that daily bouts of cyclic stretch elevated calpain levels and presumably remodeling (Fig.  2b ). Myotubes that completed stretch cessation myotubes displayed calpain levels that were not statistically different than the no-stretch and 2dHY groups. Calpain activity was significantly lower in the 3dAT group vs. 5dHY myotubes. Akt and Foxo3a signaling is altered by cyclic stretch and removal of cyclic stretch The Akt activation pathway has been involved in regulating muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. To reveal the effects of daily cyclic stretch and subsequent cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch, we measured total Akt, phosphorylated Akt at Thr308, total protein levels for FoxO3a, phosphorylated FoxO3a, and the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio (Fig.  3 ). Our data revealed that phosphorylated Akt levels were elevated after daily bouts of cyclic stretch (Fig.  4b ). The phosphorylated Akt to total Akt activity ratio trended upwards with 2 days of a daily cyclic stretch but was not different from than controls (Fig.  3c ). Akt phosphorylation levels were significantly lower in 3dAT than in 2dHY but were no different than controls (Fig.  3b ). pAkt/total Akt for 3dAT was similar to the no stretch control group.

Protein abundance quantification was determined using Western immunoblotting with Ponceau stain as a protein loading control and quantified using ImageJ. Myotubes were divided into the following groups ( n  = 4/group): 2 days quiescent control (no stretch (2d), 2 days cyclic stretch (2dHY), 5 days cyclic stretch (5dHY), and 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). ( a ) = statistically significant difference from no-stretch (2d); ( b ) = significantly different than 2dHY; ( c ) = significantly different than 5dHY. ( p  ≤ 0.05) Values are presented as Box plots ±SD. The boxplots illustrate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentiles) displayed with whiskers spanning from the 10th to the 90th percentiles. The median of the data is indicated by the central line. The FoxO3a transcription factor can be phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt phosphorylation or conversely dephosphorylated and stimulated by pro-inflammatory signaling. Total protein levels for FoxO3a were elevated by almost 3-fold after cessation of daily cyclic stretch compared with the no stretch, 2dHY and 5dHY groups (Fig.  3d ). However, the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a levels were significantly lower in the 3dAT group than in controls and trended lower than in the myotubes subjected to daily bouts of cyclic strain (Fig.  3f ). The data suggest that FoxO3a levels are elevated, and the proportion of dephosphorylated FoxO3a and thus activated FoxO3a is upregulated with when daily bouts of cyclic stretch are removed. Catabolic, inflammatory signaling in response to daily cyclic stretch and cessation of stretch In order to understand whether the cessation of cyclic strain and subsequent atrophy was linked with catabolic, inflammatory signaling, we interrogated three canonical inflammatory proteins that contribute to skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during unloading. For this purpose, we measured myotube levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as the p65 subunit of the pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). Protein abundance detected through immunoblotting revealed no statistical difference in IL-1ß, IL-6, and p65 among myotubes subjected to no stretch, 2 days of cyclic stretch, and 5 days of cyclic stretch (Fig.  4 ). However, there was a 2–3 fold increase in IL-1ß, IL-6, and p65 compared with 2dHY, 5dHY, and the no stretch controls, similar to the pattern observed in total FoxO3a levels. These data suggest a significant role of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kappaB in myotube atrophy following the removal of daily bouts of cyclic stretch. Discussion In the current study, we examined the efficacy of the application and withdrawal of uniaxial cyclic stretch on myotubes as a prospective bioreactor for use in spaceflight research. The uniaxial cyclic stretch produced tensile loading on myotubes with some shear in anchoring interface with laminin on the dish or membrane. Withdrawal from cyclic stretch elicits an ‘off-transient’ period that our data suggest mimics unloading-microgravity. The cyclic stretch protocol (12% sinusoidal stretch, 0.7 Hz waveform frequency, 1 hour/day) over 2 and 5 days produced marked hypertrophy of skeletal muscle myotubes, accompanied by elevated anabolic markers (talin, Akt phosphorylation at Thr308). In contrast, withdrawal and cessation of cyclic stretch resulted in substantial atrophy on myotube diameter, concomitant with reduced Akt phosphorylation, and elevation of catabolic, pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-1ß, IL-6, NF-kappaB subunit p65) as well as proteolytic signaling (e.g., reduced FoxO3a phosphorylation/total FoxO3a ratio, elevated total FoxO3a). A discussion of the physiological and technological development relevance follows. These findings have a number of parallels with the data published by Soltow, et al. (2013) 35  using the FlexCell® as a model for overloading and unloading (e.g., microgravity). The FlexCell®’s 2 days cyclic stretching protocol (12%, 0.7 Hz,1 h/d) using collagen-coated plates increased myotube diameter, talin levels, Akt phosphorylation activity, and FoxO3a phosphorylation leading to stretch-induced muscle hypertrophy and growth. In contrast, 48 h after the removal of bouts of cyclic stretch resulted in decreased anabolic signaling, increased FoxO3a dephosphorylation, thus activating pro-inflammatory and muscle atrophic signaling and causing smaller myotube diameter. These data suggest that uniaxial stretch and cessation of stretch can be validly used to test myotube responses to both increased and decreased mechanical loading. In contrast, rotating wall vessels bioreactors are commonly used in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate microgravity conditions. These bioreactors create a three-dimensional culture environment with low shear forces, mimicking some aspects of weightlessness. However, they are not effective in inducing the primary consequence of weightlessness on skeletal muscles, which is a dramatically reduced tensile load. Furthermore, centrifugation adds compressive stress to alleviate microgravity, a far different loading profile that skeletal muscles and attached tendons experience (e.g., tension along the long axis) in a terrestrial environment. Increased tensile stress and strain in skeletal muscle fibers promote muscle growth by elevating protein synthesis and altering protein degradation, thus initiating muscle hypertrophy 40 – 42 . Recent reports also characterized an increase in myotube diameter ex vivo in response to mechanical stretch and stimulation 35 , 43 , 44 . In our StrexCell application, the uniaxial cyclic stretching protocol for 2 days and 5 days produced tensile loading on myotubes, which resulted in muscle fiber hypertrophy. Thus, loading of tensile force stimulated an increased myotube diameter and size, confirming that cyclic stretch in myotubes elicits hypertrophy of the muscle fibers (Fig.  1 ). Overloading produced by cyclic stretch induced muscle hypertrophy that was directly linked to increased markers of anabolism and hypertrophy, including upregulation of talin and increased Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. Akt activation is a causal regulator in protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle 45 , 46 . For example, the overexpression of active Akt levels previously elicited skeletal muscle myotube hypertrophy 47 . Furthermore, we found that bouts cyclic stretch activated Akt through phosphorylation at Thr308, which was linked to an elevated phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio which could suppress catabolism. Consistently, we previously demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme mimetic EUK-134 relieved unloading induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation (deactivation) and decrease in FoxO3a phosphorylation (activation) 5 .

  "methods": "Methods Cell culture proliferation and differential protocol We used a commonly used immortal cell line (C2C12) (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA, USA) derived from mouse skeletal muscle, generously provide by Dr. James Fluckey’s Muscle Biology Laboratory at Texas A&M University. C2C12 cells were capable of differentiation and are a widely used model to study differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in a 10 cm2 chamber filled with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, growth medium (DMEM + NA Pyruvate), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 35 , 73 .  Once the myoblast cultures reached 60–65% confluency, the myoblasts were then trypsinized and re-cultured in 4 well-2 cm 2  silicone chambers coated by laminin at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 , using 1 ml per well. Once the cells reached 70–80% confluency, myotube differentiation was initiated by switching to differentiation medium DMEM (-) NA Pyruvate, supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.4% insulin-transferrin-selenium. To study the effects of increased and decreased mechanical stress in C2C12 myotubes, we maintained myotubes on laminin-coated silastic membrane and initiated stretch through a StrexCell® system, then observed the effects of stretch and cessation of stretch on cellular responses 34 . Twelve hours after beginning differentiation, the myotube silicone chambers were exposed to the uniaxial stretching using the StrexCell® unit. The differentiation medium was refreshed daily under sterilized conditions. StrexCell loading and unloading protocol Cyclic stretch of skeletal muscle cell cultures or “myotubes” has been used to mimic the loading pattern of skeletal muscle-induced hypertrophy and atrophy 74 . However, several limitations for the FlexCell system that could impair compatibility for research in spaceflight, including the necessity of a powerful vacuum pump, considerable weight, and difficulty generating true uniaxial stretch. StrexCell® uses a stepper motor and modular contractile cartridges to generate uniaxial stretch on muscle fibers mounted on the silastic membrane. StrexCell is automated and computer-controlled, which enables precise control of the strain levels on the cells, providing a consistent stretch at high and low frequencies of 1–20%. Myoblasts and myotubes on a StrexCell system were exposed to uniaxial stress/tensile loads and release of tensile loading. While the myotubes were not free floating, they are plated on laminin that simulates the extracellular matrix/endothelium normally attached to muscle fibers surrounding myocytes. The myoblast and myotubes were then suspended in an aqueous medium, which induces equal pressure on all sides. At the micron level, gravity is a relatively weak force compared with adhesions, ion affinity, intermolecular forces, and fluid dynamics, especially in an aqueous medium that surrounds the myoblasts and myotube",

Recent reports also characterized an increase in myotube diameter ex vivo in response to mechanical stretch and stimulation 35 , 43 , 44 . In our StrexCe",
