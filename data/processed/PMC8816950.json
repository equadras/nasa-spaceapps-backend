  "abstract": "Water unavailability is an abiotic stress causing unfavourable conditions for life. Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigrade  Paramacrobiotus spatialis  was used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the  P. spatialis  was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Insufficient hydration is extremely stressful for living organisms as water is required for metabolic reactions. Nevertheless, some animals living in habitats subject to periodic or unpredictable desiccation periods have evolved a remarkable adaptive strategy called anhydrobiosis. This physiological state allows for the nearly complete dehydration of the animal’s body and cells, a reduced or suspended metabolism leading to a temporary suspension of active life processes, and finally a developmental standstill as a direct response to the desiccation of the surrounding habitat of the animals 1 – 4 . This state is reversed by the reappearance of environmental water, with the restoring of metabolism and of all features of active life, even after the permanence in a desiccated state for months to decades 1 , 2 , 4 – 6 . However, anhydrobiosis, as well as the time spent in a desiccated state, can still cause cellular damages, including membrane destabilization, protein and nucleic acid denaturation, metabolic dysregulation, and oxidative stress with the eventual death of organisms 7 – 16 . To withstand stress caused by the drastic loss of body water, many anhydrobiotic animals first slow the rate of their dehydration by modifying their body in a compact structure that reduces the surface area, and consequently the evaporation rate 17 – 19 . Simultaneously, they undergo biochemical changes associated with the synthesis of molecules working as bioprotectants, which replace cellular water or stabilize cellular machinery 13 , 20 – 27 . To gain insights into anhydrobiosis and what bioprotectants help to mediate this phenomenon, tardigrades are an attractive model. Tardigrades are hygrophilous animals that need to be surrounded by a film of water to perform active life. As a consequence, their capability to colonise terrestrial environments (e.g. moss, lichen, soil, and leaf litter) is linked to their well-known ability to enter anhydrobiosis at any stage of their life cycle, from egg to adult 28 . As their surroundings lose water, tardigrades lose most (> 95%) of their free and bound body water and suspend their metabolism 3 . The loss of water is accompanied by the invagination of the intersegmental cuticle and by the retraction of the head and legs, resulting in a compact tun-shaped body 3 , 29 , 30 . Anhydrobiotic (desiccated) tardigrades can withstand several physical and chemical extremes (e.g. very low and high temperature, high pressure, vacuum, organic solvents and radiations) that are far more extreme than that imposed by their natural habitats, including space conditions 3 , 25 , 26 , 31 – 36 . As well as in other anhydrobiotic animals, the desiccation in tardigrades is accomplished through morphological changes (tun) together with the synthesis of different bioprotectants 20 – 22 , 24 – 27 . These molecules include, for example, osmolytes, trehalose, antioxidants, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs), Aquaporin Proteins (AQPs) and Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), including the Late Embryogenesis Abundant Proteins (LEA) 13 , 20 – 22 , 24 – 27 . Trehalose, a disaccharide with high ability for water-replacement during dehydration, immobilising macromolecules and stabilizing cellular structure through vitrification has long been implicated in desiccation tolerance 20 , 26 , 37 . The presence and the amount of trehalose detected in tardigrades are different from species to species 27 , but is much lower than the one recorded in other anhydrobiotic animals that use trehalose as mechanism to reduce damages induced by desiccation 1 , 38 – 40 . Therefore, the degree of involvement of trehalose as a protective molecule in anhydrobiotic tardigrades is still debated 27 . Antioxidants, such as scavenging enzymes, limit oxidative stress, which appears to be one of the most deleterious damages associated with desiccation 9 . The depletion of water changes the ionic concentration of anhydrobiotic organisms, including tardigrades 41 , leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 9 , 11 , 42 , 43 , consisting in free radicals [e.g. superoxide anion radical (O 2 − ), hydroxyl radical (OH·), perhydroxy radical (HO 2 ·)] and non-radical forms [e.g .  hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 )] 44 . Water loss therefore increases the susceptibility of biomolecules to the attack of reactive oxygen molecules, damaging proteins, membranes, and DNA 9 , 11 , 13 , 22 , 27 , 42 , 43 . Since aquaporins contribute to water transport through plasma membranes, some researchers have suggested that they play some role in anhydrobiosis, hypothesizing their involvement in the regulation of water loss to fine tune desiccation kinetics 11 , 23 , 45 – 47 . However, it remains unclear if aquaporins function in preparing anhydrobiotic animals for desiccation or play a role in rehydration. In this paper, the eutardigrade  Paramacrobiotus spatialis  Guidetti et al., 2019 was selected as a model organism (Fig.  1 ) in light of its robust ability to survive desiccation 10 , 48 . To understand what bioprotectants might be involved in mitigating the stresses imposed by desiccation, we first sought to identify exactly what those stresses are. As mentioned above, water loss can lead to the generation of deleterious ROS, however this has never been directly tested before in tardigrades. To verify whether desiccation induces production of ROS in tardigrades, we analysed the ROS production in the coelomocytes (storage cells; Fig.  1 c). Coelomocytes are round free-floating cells in the body cavity of tardigrades which act as reservoirs and transporters of lipids and glycogen 49 – 52 . The number of storage cells in a tardigrade specimen is in the range of a few hundred up to more than 1000 cells according to the species 4 , 52 , 53 , while their size changes along with animal life cycle including oocyte developmental in females 54 . Contrasting data are reported about the decline in size and number of storage cells after a period of anhydrobiosis in tardigrade species 51 – 53 . A decline in size of storage cells is due to the use of stored material as energy requirements to enter and exit anhydrobiosis 51 . Figure 1 Paramacrobiotus spatialis .

Next, we investigated possible roles for endogenous protectants, such as antioxidant enzymes, aquaporin proteins and the sugar trehalose, in desiccation tolerance. Genes encoding five antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase), for two aquaporins (aquaporins 3 and 10) and for the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase were thus targeted using RNA interference (RNAi), and later the successful recover of  P. spatialis  specimens after desiccation was verified. Results Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in anhydrobiosis The overall level of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was assessed using the fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH 2 -DA) 55 , 56 . The ROS production in anhydrobiosis was determined measuring the intensity of the fluorescent signal emitted by storage cells of the desiccation tolerant tardigrade  P. spatialis . Storage cells are particularly useful as they are numerous as well as the only cell type within the tardigrade body cavity. Storage cells are also easy to obtain and manipulate, whereas other tissues in tardigrades are more difficult to obtain and work with (Fig.  1 c,d). Figure  2  shows the fluorescence signals detected respectively 3 h and 12 h after the rehydration process in tardigrade storage cells previously kept in a desiccated state for 1 day and 20 days, and in the animals kept in a hydrated state as control.

The storage cells of desiccated animals always emitted an intense fluorescence signal, while those of control ones emitted a faint spotted fluorescence signal (Fig. 2). The intensity of the fluorescence signal emitted by the storage cells of desiccated animals was always significantly higher than the fluorescence intensity detected in cells of control animals (Fig. 2; Table  1 ; one-way ANOVA: n = 485;  p  < 0.001). Moreover, the intensity of the fluorescence signal was at its highest level in the coelomocytes of animals kept desiccated for 20 days, while the lowest signal was recorded in cells of tardigrades kept desiccated for 1 day (Fig. 2; Table  1 ).

Disruption of target genes function RNA interference (RNAi) was used to disrupt the function of genes encoding proteins potentially involved in desiccation tolerance in the tardigrade  Paramacrobiotus spatialis.  RNAi has previously been characterized in tardigrades and is known to target specific gene products for destruction both in adults during desiccation and in embryos during development 24 , 57 . Similarly, it has been shown that large amounts of non-specific dsRNA (e.g .  double stranded RNA targeting GFP) do not affect tardigrade survival 24  nor embryo viability and development 57 . In this study, the eight genes targeted by RNAi were:  gpx ,  gr ,  gst ,  cat  and  sod , encoding for enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, respectively) that counteract reactive oxygen species;  tps , encoding for the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, involved in the pathways of trehalose production;  aqp 3  and  aqp 10 , encoding for aquaporin proteins 3 and 10, which are presumably involved in the rapid transport of water through cell membranes. The involvement of these target genes was verified by comparing the motilities of  P. spatialis  animals that have exited tun belonging to three groups: 1. uninjected control animals (control 1); 2. injected with RNase free water control animals (control 2); 3. injected animals with the double stranded RNA (dsRNA) of the target gene (experimental group). The motility of the animals after a period of anhydrobiosis was evaluated by monitoring locomotion performance (i.e. coordinate movements of the body) immediately after the rehydration process (t 0 ), 1 h (t 1 ), 24 h (t 24 ), and 48 h (t 48 ) later. Additionally, five specimens of  P. spatialis  were individually injected with dsRNA of each target gene, desiccated, and then rehydrated. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a marked decrease in the expression level of each target gene in comparison to DNA polymerase II ( DNA pol II ) used as a control gene (Fig.  S1 ), indicating that RNA interference led to a decrease in the targeted gene’s expression level. The assessment of motility in both control 1 (uninjected) and control 2 (water injected) animals always resulted 100% (Fig.  3 a,b), since all animals are alive at each time point assayed after the rehydration process. These data demonstrate that the desiccation protocol was suitable for  P. spatialis , and that the injection alone does not affect survival of the tardigrades during anhydrobiosis. On the other hand, significant differences were recorded between the motility percentages of both controls and most experimental groups (Fig.  3 ; Kruskal–Wallis test: number of pairwise comparisons = 132;  p  < 0.001). For treatments targeting antioxidant enzymes, specimens injected with dsRNA of  gpx  showed significantly lower motilities with respect to both types of controls at every time after the rehydration process (t 0 :  p  < 0.001; t 1 :  p  < 0.01; t 24 :  p  < 0.01; t 48 :  p  < 0.01; Fig.  3 c). In animals injected with dsRNA for genes of  gr ,  cat  and  sod , significant differences with respect to both types of controls were only observed between the percentages of animal motilities recorded at t 0  (immediately after the rehydration process) ( gr :  p  < 0.01;  cat :  p  < 0.01;  sod :  p  < 0.01; Fig.  3 d,f,g). Significant differences in the motility percentages with respect to both types of controls were also evidenced at t 0 , t 1  and t 24  in animals injected with dsRNA of  aqp 3  (t 0 :  p  < 0.01, t 1 :  p  < 0.05; t 24 :  p  < 0.05; Fig.  3 i) and at t 0 , t 1  and t 24  in animals injected with dsRNA of  aqp 10  (t 0 :  p  < 0.001, t 24 :  p  < 0.01; t 48 :  p  < 0.01; Fig.  3 j).The motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA of the  gst  and  tps  genes did not show significant differences with respect to both types of controls (uninjected and water injected) at every time after the rehydration process (Fig.  3 e,h). Since RNAi knockdown of the  tps  gene resulted in negligible effects on the animal motilities at all times following rehydration, and since the  tps  dsRNA was the largest used in our study (Table  S2 ), we consider this gene as a further control (control 3), and further evidences that the injection of large amount of dsRNA is not harmful for  P. spatialis . The motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA targeting the  tps  gene compared with the motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA of other target genes shows significant differences (Table  S3 ). These statistical differences are consistent with the scored significances of comparisons between controls (non-injected and water injected) and target genes, except for motility at t 0  of animals injected with  sod  dsRNA, motilities at t 1  and t 24  of animals targeted for  aqp 3  and motilities at t 24  and t 48  of animals targeted for  aqp 10  (Fig.  3 ; Table  S3 ). Therefore, only for these exceptions is it possible to presume an effect on  P. spatialis  motilities was due to injection of large dsRNA.

Discussion This study provides an evaluation of oxidative stress production during desiccation in tardigrades through the direct assessment of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in storage cells. In addition, this study assesses the degree of involvement of various bioprotectants in anhydrobiotic survival of tardigrades using RNA interference to perturb gene functions in  Paramacrobiotus spatialis. Storage cells are singular free-floating cells accumulating polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins 49 , 50 , 58 . The faint spotted fluorescence emitted by the storage cells of the control specimens of  P. spatialis  denotes that in metabolically active animals there is a regular, but small, production of ROS due to the standard metabolic reactions. This has been reported in all living organisms, not only related to anhydrobiosis (see França et al. 9 ; Kranner & Birtić 43 ; Boveris & Chance 59 ). The storage cells of desiccated specimens of  P. spatialis  emitted an intense fluorescence, demonstrating that anhydrobiosis causes a significant increase in ROS production and consequently of oxidative stress. Previous reports evaluated the oxidative stress associated with desiccation in tardigrades indirectly, by assessing the antioxidant defences mounted in response to drying in whole animals 22 , 46 , or by evaluating the ROS-damaged proteins that can accumulate as carbonylated products during the anhydrobiotic period 60 . Evidence of the production of free radicals (and consequently of oxidative stress) in anhydrobiosis has been found in other organisms, such as cyanobacteria (see Potts 61 ), the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (see Pereira et al. 62 ) ,  intertidal seaweeds (see Flores-Molina et al. 63 ), the moss  Fontinalis antipyretica  (see Cruz de Carvalho et al. 64 ) and the shrimp  Marsupenaeus japonicas  (see Duan et al. 65 ). In tardigrades, ROS production occurs both during desiccation, and while in a desiccated state. These data can explain the increase in mortality and/or in a long recovery time (i.e. time to recover active life after desiccation) measured in  P. spatialis  specimens after extended periods in a desiccated state 10 . These two phenomena are directly proportional to the time spent in a desiccated state, since molecular damages are ",

  "methods": "Methods Collection of the target species The eutardigrade  Paramacrobiotus spatialis  Guidetti et al. 2019 was used as target species. Specimens were collected from hazel-leaf litter at Formigine (80 m a.s.l.; 44° 34.253′ N, 10° 50.892′ E, Modena, Northern Italy). Leaf litter was immersed in tap water and then animals were extracted from their substrate by means of sieves, picked up with a glass pipette under a stereomicroscope and stored in tap water and natural mineral water 1:1 (rearing water) at 16 °C for 24 h before their use 10 , 31 . Experimental desiccation and rehydration of tardigrades Animals were desiccated using a climate chamber (CHL, Angelantoni Industrie, Milan, Italy) that allows to control air temperature and relative humidity (RH) of the air. Animals were placed on a blot filter paper with a drop of rearing water and kept at 18 °C and 80% RH for 4 h, then to 50% RH for 4 h, and finally at 20 °C and 0–3% RH overnight 41 . At the end of these steps, the tardigrade body has the typical compact tun shape structure of a desiccated/anhydrobiotic tardigrade (Fig.  1 d). To rehydrate desiccated tardigrades, small amounts of rearing water were slowly added on each filter paper every 10 min for a total of 60 min, this rehydration step is here termed the “rehydration process”. Rehydrated tardigrades were maintained at 16 °C and observed under a stereomicroscope. Coordinated and active movements of the body (locomotion performance) constituted the criterion to evaluate tardigrade motility (survival). Locomotion performance was evaluated right after the rehydration process (t 0 ) and after 1 h (t 1 ) and 24 h (t 24 ) (see Altiero et al. 34 ). Detection of reactive oxygen species production under desiccation The production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was detected after specimens of  P. spatialis  were kept in a desiccated state for 1 and 20 days (see above protocol) at 16 °C and 0–3% RH. In particular, ROS production was evaluated in coelomocytes (storage cells) 3 and 12 h after the rehydration process. As control, specimens kept in rearing water were used. For each experimental conditions and controls, 2–5 animals were used, and for each animal 6–45 singular storage cells randomly chosen were analysed (Table  S1 ). The fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH 2 -DA) diluted in methanol was used. It is the most common probe to detect overall level of intracellular ROS 55 , 56 . Preliminary tests evidenced that tardigrades survive when kept for 45 min in methanol used for dilution (methanol: distilled water, 1:10). Each tardigrade was sonicated for 90 s in rearing water to allow the entrance of the probe in the tardigrade, and then incubated in 1 ml of 10 µM DCFH 2 -DA in methanol for 45 min at 20 °C in the dark. After these steps, each tardigrade was washed with rearing water, mounted on a slide with rearing water as mounting medium. Then, the animal was gently broken with a pressure on cover slip to obtain the r",

  "discussion": "Discussion This study provides an evaluation of oxidative stress production during desiccation in tardigrades through the direct assessment of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in storage cells. In addition, this study assesses the degree of involvement of various bioprotectants in anhydrobiotic survival of tardigrades using RNA interference to perturb gene functions in  Paramacrobiotus spatialis. Storage cells are singular free-floating cells accumulating polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins 49 , 50 , 58 . The faint spotted fluorescence emitted by the storage cells of the control specimens of  P. spatialis  denotes that in metabolically active animals there is a regular, but small, production of ROS due to the standard metabolic reactions. This has been reported in all living organisms, not only related to anhydrobiosis (see França et al. 9 ; Kranner & Birtić 43 ; Boveris & Chance 59 ). The storage cells of desiccated specimens of  P. spatialis  emitted an intense fluorescence, demonstrating that anhydrobiosis causes a significant increase in ROS production and consequently of oxidative stress. Previous reports evaluated the oxidative stress associated with desiccation in tardigrades indirectly, by assessing the antioxidant defences mounted in response to drying in whole animals 22 , 46 , or by evaluating the ROS-damaged proteins that can accumulate as carbonylated products during the anhydrobiotic period 60 . Evidence of the production of free radicals (and consequently of oxidative stress) in anhydrobiosis has been found in other organisms, such as cyanobacteria (see Potts 61 ), the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (see Pereira et al. 62 ) ,  intertidal seaweeds (see Flores-Molina et al. 63 ), the moss  Fontinalis antipyretica  (see Cruz de Carvalho et al. 64 ) and the shrimp  Marsupenaeus japonicas  (see Duan et al. 65 ). In tardigrades, ROS production occurs both during desiccation, and while in a desiccated state. These data can explain the increase in mortality and/or in a long recovery time (i.e. time to recover active life after desiccation) measured in  P. spatialis  specimens after extended periods in a desiccated state 10 . These two phenomena are directly proportional to the time spent in a desiccated state, since molecular damages are accumulated with time because metabolism is arrested, and repair systems are not working 10 . Oxidative stress leads to a long recovery time and to the death of tardigrades since the animals need more time to repair oxidation damages. The glutathione pathway, including the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase, is an important antioxidant system involved in the scavenging of ROS 13 . In this pathway, the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase act by removing hydrogen peroxide, while the glutathione reductase reduces the glutathione disulphide to glutathione 9 , 43 .
