  "abstract": "This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in  Drosophila melanogaster  and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified. Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate  Drosophila  enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty  Drosophila  candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring  Drosophila  candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the  D .  melanogaster  genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of  Drosophila  genetics. Such experimental analysis of eicosanoid biology in a simple model organism will have high relevance to human development and health.",

  "full_text": "Introduction The eicosanoids are a family of biologically active lipids that have been implicated in various signaling pathways, with a central role in mammalian immunity and inflammation [ 1 – 3 ]. The canonical eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway begins with the release of fatty acids, primarily arachidonic acid (AA), from membrane phospholipids when phospholipase A 2  is activated [ 4 , 5 ]. The canonical pathway then diverges, depending on whether the fatty acid substrate is processed by a cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), or a P450 epoxygenase (P450E). The COX enzymes generate prostanoids (prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes), resolvins, and electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [ 6 – 8 ] whereas the LOX enzymes produce the leukotrienes, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and lipoxins [ 9 ]. There is some cross-talk between the COX and LOX pathways, as both are known to produce hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) [ 10 , 11 ]. The P450 epoxygenase pathway yields epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) [ 12 ]. These downstream products regulate diverse signaling pathways and biological processes [ 2 , 3 , 12 – 14 ] The COX and LOX branches of the eicosanoid pathway are well-characterized in humans. The COX enzymes (prostaglandin G/H synthases) are encoded by  COX-1  ( PTGS1 ) and  COX-2  ( PTGS2 ) [ 6 ].  COX-1  is constitutively expressed at low levels by most cells. In contrast,  COX-2  is upregulated at sites of inflammation and during tumor progression [ 6 , 15 ]. COX-1 and COX-2 are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that catalyze the conversion of an 18–22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA, typically AA, an ω-6, 20-carbon fatty acid) into prostaglandins G 2  and H 2 [ 16 ]. Although AA is the preferred substrate, the COX enzymes are known to oxygenate eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHLA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with varying efficiencies [ 16 – 18 ]. This initial substrate choice is significant, as it determines whether the downstream prostanoid will tend to be pro- or anti-inflammatory. Fatty acids with two double bonds (e.g., AA) are converted into series-2 prostanoids ( e . g ., PGH 2 , PGE 2 ), which are associated with pro-inflammatory signaling. In contrast, fatty acid substrates with three or four double bonds (e.g., EPA, DHLA, respectively) yield series-1 and 3 prostanoids (PGH 1 , PGE 3 ), which are associated with anti-inflammatory signaling. Some COX products, such as the anti-inflammatory resolvins are synthesized only from EPA and DHA, whereas the pro- and anti-inflammatory 9- and 13-HODEs are generated from LA by COX enzymes [ 8 , 10 ]. Nevertheless, AA is the primary substrate for COX enzymes and so COX signaling tends to be pro-inflammatory. As a result, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which inhibit COX-1/2’s ability to generate pro-inflammatory products, are particularly important. PGH2 is subsequently converted to a variety of downstream eicosanoids, including PGD 2 , PGE 2 , PGF 1α  PGF 2α , PGI 2  (prostacyclin), and the thromboxanes TXA 2  and TXB 2 . The downstream processing route depends on the availability of enzymes in a given cell type. For example, endothelial cells primarily produce PGI 2 , whereas platelets mainly produce TXA 2  [ 19 ]. The LOX pathway operates independently from the COX pathway, diverging at the initial fatty acid processing stage. In humans, LOX enzymes are encoded by several genes ( ALOX5 ,  ALOX12 ,  ALOX12B ,  ALOX15 ). Mammalian LOX enzymes catalyze the stereospecific dehydrogenation and dioxygenation of a PUFA, such as AA or LA, leading to the formation of a hydroxyperoxide containing a 1-hydroxyperoxy-2- trans -4- cis -pentadiene fragment [ 13 , 20 ]. The mammalian LOXs have been named according to the position of the carbon at which the oxygen molecule is inserted into AA, the primary fatty acid substrate,  e . g ., as 5-, 12-, or 15-LOX) [ 21 ]. The primary products are 5S-, 12S-, or 15S-HPETE, which can be further reduced by glutathione peroxidase to hydroxy forms (5-, 12-, 15-HETE), respectively [ 20 , 21 ]. 5-LOX is the only LOX that produces leukotrienes, and it is notable that catalytic activity requires the presence of a second protein (ALOX5AP), though the precise function of Five-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein (FLAP) is not known [ 20 , 22 ]. Following conversion of a fatty acid into 5-HPETE, downstream processing results in the terminal leukotrienes LTB 4 , LTC 4 , LTD 4 , and LTE 4 . The leukotrienes are clinically significant, as they are implicated in the allergic response and maintenance of chronic inflammation. 15-LOX (and to a lesser extent 5-LOX) produce the lipoxins LXA and LXB [ 23 ]. CYP450Es convert fatty acid substrates ( e . g ., AA) into four EET isomers, 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs, which function as autocrine and paracrine mediators. CYP450Es also convert EPA into epoxy-derivatives, and endocannabinoids containing 11,12- and 14,15-EETs [ 12 ]. The CYP450E protein is not examined in this study. The COX family enzymes are highly conserved across the animal kingdom, with orthologs found in the primitive marine corals as well as the higher vertebrates [ 24 ]. Traditional genomic analyses have failed to identify COX orthologs in the known genomes of insects, unicellular organisms, or plants, although prostaglandins, their primary products, have been found in some of these organisms [ 25 – 28 ]. Recent studies have suggested that an insect cyclooxygenase may exist in orthologs of the  Drosophila  gene  Pxt  [ 27 , 29 , 30 ]. LOX enzymes display an even broader degree of conservation, with orthologs found across the animal kingdom and in a variety of plants [ 9 ]. Sequence and biochemical analyses have failed to identify any insect LOX orthologs, with the exception of LOX activity in the primitive insect,  Thermobia domestica  [ 31 ] and one report in  D .  melanogaster  [ 28 ]. Thus, there is conflicting information regarding the existence of functional COX or LOX pathway in insects. Given the complexity and biomedical importance of eicosanoid biology, defining the COX and LOX pathways in a model organism is a research priority. Identification of a functionally conserved COX or LOX pathway in  D .  melanogaster  opens up exciting research avenues for understanding the genetic basis of eicosanoid-mediated inflammation in this well-established and simple model organism. To this end, we conducted a thorough computational analysis of the genome of  D .  melanogaster . While an initial BLAST search revealed candidates for the most conserved enzymes, it failed to identify likely orthologs for some of these enzymes. A more rigorous approach using iterative sequence searches combined with structural modeling revealed a surprising degree of similarity between mammalian and fly enzymes and the apparent conservation of functionally important residues even in these most distant candidate enzymes. Although we could not identify any suitable candidates for lipoxygenase enzymes, other component enzymes of the LOX branch of the pathway were identified. This suggests the possibility that eicosanoid pathway may adopt a non-canonical form in  D .  melanogaster  and insects in general. Our study challenges the current view that insects lack a functional eicosanoid pathway and opens up tremendous possibilities of utilizing a well-established model organism for eicosanoid research. Materials and methods A flowchart summarizing the general protocol of the present study with the various tools used to identify and characterize putative  D .  melanogaster  orthologs for the classic eicosanoid synthesis enzymes discussed in detail below is shown in  Fig 1 . 10.1371/journal.pone.0211897.g001 Fig 1 Summary of the workflow and tools used to carry out the present study. A schematic of the workflow devised to identify, model, and characterize various orthologs of the human eicosanoid pathway. Identification and characterization of human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes A canonical eicosanoid synthesis pathway in humans was compiled from the NCBI BioSystems Database using the Eicosanoid Synthesis (BSID: 198888) and Arachidonic Acid pathway maps (BSID: 829971) [ 32 ]. Protein sequence(s) for each human canonical pathway gene were obtained from the NCBI RefSeq database [ 33 ]. Enzymes selected for this study are listed in  Table 1  (see  Results  section). For each enzyme, either the sole protein product or the major isoform was selected as the representative sequence. Known and high-confidence predicted orthologs for each enzyme were identified using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) Orthology database [ 34 ]. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for each target enzyme with the selected orthologs was then generated using PROMALS3D, followed by manual editing [ 35 ]. Domains and active sites on each identified enzyme were annotated using the Pfam, InterPro, CDART, and Uniprot databases [ 36 – 38 ]. Consensus secondary structure profiles were generated using the PsiPred, JPred and PSSPred servers [ 39 – 41 ] to confirm identified functional domains and to ascertain domain boundaries. 10.1371/journal.pone.0211897.t001 Table 1 Summary of  D .  melanogaster  eicosanoid synthesis enzymes candidates.

The candidates are denoted in the Annotation identifier column as high-confidence (regular font), mid-range ( underlined ), and distant ( italicized and bold font ). Gene annotation IDs (distinct from gene symbols) are represented in a common way: a species-specific 2 letter prefix followed by a four or five digit integer. CG is the 2-letter prefix for  D .  melanogaster  for protein-coding genes. ¥ The template 1M0U is the crystal structure for a fragment of this protein (position 48–249). The N-terminal region was built using MODELLER’s  ab initio  methods. Identification of potential eicosanoid synthesis enzymes in  D .  melanogaster We used several different sequence analysis algorithms to identify candidate  Drosophila  orthologs for each human enzyme. Specifically, each human enzyme reference sequence was queried against a subset of the  D .  melanogaster  NCBI non-redundant sequence database using PSI-BLAST, DELTA-BLAST or JACKHMMER [ 42 – 44 ]. For this, each human enzyme reference sequence was queried against a subset of the  D .  melanogaster  NCBI non-redundant sequence database. DELTA-BLAST is a more sensitive variant of the traditional BLAST algorithm that incorporates domain information from pre-constructed position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) in order to improve detection of homology [ 42 ]. JACKHMMER is an alternative sequence analysis and alignment tool that operates in an iterative fashion by generating a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) for a query protein, searching the target sequence database, and then updating the HMM to include sequences that score above a given cut-off value [ 44 ]. For this study, specialized BLAST and HMMer algorithms were leveraged as part of a combined approach to identify candidates which may be remote homologs for the human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Each search was conducted with three iterations using the default parameters.  D .  melanogaster  candidates with statistically significant full-length alignments to the query were selected after each round. These candidates were then analyzed using the same secondary structure and domain analysis tools as discussed above. Each candidate was then aligned against the previously generated MSA (containing the human enzyme and known/predicted orthologs) in order to screen out hits that lacked required functional residues and/or those with substantially dissimilar secondary structure or domain architecture. In silico  modeling of  D .  melanogaster  candidates Full-length three-dimensional models were generated for each top-scoring  D .  melanogaster  candidate protein thus identified using the HHpred, MODELLER, LOMETS and I-TASSER software packages [ 45 – 48 ] HHpred performs sensitive searches to detect protein homology, function, and structure prediction based on HMM–HMM comparison and uses MODELLER to create the models. MODELLER, a homology modeling tool, predicts the tertiary structure of a protein based on satisfaction of spatial restraints derived from sequentially similar templates whose structure is known ( i . e ., a sequence-sequence comparison). In contrast, I-TASSER utilizes a multi-threading algorithm ( i . e ., a sequence-structure comparison) to identify suitable templates followed by an iterative template fragment assembly approach based on replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations to generate the full length model; unaligned primary sequence regions are built using  ab initio  methods. LOMETS is a meta-server that generates and ranks modeling results produced using several alternative threading algorithms which are executed in parallel. The accuracy of homology modeling depends largely on the target-template alignment, with ≥40% sequence identity generally yielding high quality models and 25% sequence identity being the lower threshold for an acceptable model [ 49 ]. However, threading based modeling tools are generally less sensitive to sequence identity differences and some packages (e.g., I-TASSER) are known to generate high quality models using templates sharing as little as 20–30% sequence identity with the target sequence [ 50 , 51 ]. Each  D .  melanogaster  candidate sequence was searched against the Protein Data Bank database of published structures [ 52 ] using PSI-BLAST and JACKHMMER [ 43 , 44 ]. Potential templates with ≥30%, full-length sequence identity were aligned against the candidate using PROMALS3D, MAFFT, and T-Coffee [ 35 , 53 , 54 ] and evaluated. If a suitable single full-length template was not found, either due to a lack of coverage or low sequence identity within the aligned range, I-TASSER was used to generate a composite model based on several templates. In each case, the initial model was used to generate a refined full atomic model using ModRefiner, which also optimizes sidechain placement [ 55 ]. All of the refined models were then evaluated using the ProSa, ProQ2 and MODFOLD4 servers [ 56 – 58 ]. Loops and unstructured N- and C-terminal regions in these models were optimized using  ab initio  methods (e.g., MODELLER’s loop routines or QUARK), refined using ModRefiner and reevaluated as necessary [ 48 , 59 ]. Unsuitable models were rejected and rebuilt using alternatives templates according to the preceding protocol. Models were analyzed using the surface property tools in the Chimera and PyMol visualization and structural modeling packages, in addition to online tools including COFACTOR, and COACH [ 60 – 63 ]TM-Score was used to perform structural comparisons of the models with the known target human enzymes [ 64 ]. Results Identification and characterization of candidate eicosanoid synthesis enzymes in  D .  melanogaster A purely sequence-based analysis of the  D .  melanogaster  genome (Release 6.04, February 24th, 2015) using traditional sequence analysis tools ( e . g ., BLASTP) failed to identify potential orthologs for some of the human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. However, using a more sensitive approach based on iterative HMMER searches, we uncovered potential  D .  melanogaster  candidates that may function as eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. A majority of these candidates were shown to adopt a highly similar tertiary structure with the human target enzymes. Template based modeling approaches produce models that are structurally similar to the templates used, so the modeled enzymes were validated using evaluation techniques that confirm that the primary sequence is compatible with its modeled three dimensional structure. To rule out potential false positives, the structure was evaluated carefully for conservation of the necessary catalytic residues in a structural context as well. A summary of our findings is provided in  Table 1 . Group 1: The high scoring matches Eight putative orthologs identified in this search have particularly high confidence matches: CG1742, CG4086, CG6084, CG10602, CG6461, CG6154, CG12013 and CG18585. These proteins share at least 30% sequence identity with the human enzyme, possess the same overall fold, and display conservation of one or more key functional residue needed for activity. The first gene in this set, CG1742 (Microsomal glutathione S-transferase (MGST) -like, isoform A,  NP_524696.1 ), encodes a protein of 152 residues and is predicted to have a single domain, Membrane Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism (MAPEG, Pfam ID: PF01124) spanning residues18 to 148 amino. This gene has also been identified in a bioinformatics screen for MAPEG family member [ 65 ]. This protein displays 36% identity and 54% similarity to the sequence of human prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES,  NP_004869.1 ). The human PTGES (PS-1) is an integral membrane protein that operates as a homotrimer and is known to catalyze the oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H 2  (PGH 2 ) to prostaglandin E 2  (PGE 2 ) [ 66 ]. PTGES is characterized by the presence of a single MAPEG domain, which spans the region 16–146. PTGES ( e . g ., PDB ID: 4AL0; [ 67 ]) and is characteristic of several proteins belonging to the MAPEG family which includes MSGT and PTGES proteins [ 68 ]. This sequence is annotated as “MSGT-like” but the predicted structure of CG1742 is nearly identical and displays an",

The COX enzymes generate prostanoids (prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes), resolvins, and electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [ 6 – 8 ] whereas the LOX enzymes produce the leukotrienes, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and lipoxins [ 9 ]. There is some cross-talk between the COX and LOX pathways, as both are known to produce hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) [ 10 , 11 ]. The P450 epoxygenase pathway yields epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) [ 12 ]. These downstream products regulate diverse signaling pathways and biological processes [ 2 , 3 , 12 – 14 ] The COX and LOX branches of the eicosanoid pathway are well-characterized in humans.

Some COX products, such as the anti-inflammatory resolvins are synthesized only from EPA and DHA, whereas the pro- and anti-inflammatory 9- and 13-HODEs are generated from LA by COX enzymes [ 8 , 10 ]. Nevertheless, AA is the primary substrate for COX enzymes and so COX signaling tends to be pro-inflammatory. As a result, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which inhibit COX-1/2’s ability to generate p",

  "results": "Results Identification and characterization of candidate eicosanoid synthesis enzymes in  D .  melanogaster A purely sequence-based analysis of the  D .  melanogaster  genome (Release 6.04, February 24th, 2015) using traditional sequence analysis tools ( e . g ., BLASTP) failed to identify potential orthologs for some of the human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. However, using a more sensitive approach based on iterative HMMER searches, we uncovered potential  D .  melanogaster  candidates that may function as eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. A majority of these candidates were shown to adopt a highly similar tertiary structure with the human target enzymes. Template based modeling approaches produce models that are structurally similar to the templates used, so the modeled enzymes were validated using evaluation techniques that confirm that the primary sequence is compatible with its modeled three dimensional structure. To rule out potential false positives, the structure was evaluated carefully for conservation of the necessary catalytic residues in a structural context as well. A summary of our findings is provided in  Table 1 . Group 1: The high scoring matches Eight putative orthologs identified in this search have particularly high confidence matches: CG1742, CG4086, CG6084, CG10602, CG6461, CG6154, CG12013 and CG18585. These proteins share at least 30% sequence identity with the human enzyme, possess the same overall fold, and display conservation of one or more key functional residue needed for activity. The first gene in this set, CG1742 (Microsomal glutathione S-transferase (MGST) -like, isoform A,  NP_524696.1 ), encodes a protein of 152 residues and is predicted to have a single domain, Membrane Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism (MAPEG, Pfam ID: PF01124) spanning residues18 to 148 amino. This gene has also been identified in a bioinformatics screen for MAPEG family member [ 65 ]. This protein displays 36% identity and 54% similarity to the sequence of human prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES,  NP_004869.1 ). The human PTGES (PS-1) is an integral membrane protein that operates as a homotrimer and is known to catalyze the oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H 2  (PGH 2 ) to prostaglandin E 2  (PGE 2 ) [ 66 ]. PTGES is characterized by the presence of a single MAPEG domain, which spans the region 16–146. PTGES ( e . g ., PDB ID: 4AL0; [ 67 ]) and is characteristic of several proteins belonging to the MAPEG family which includes MSGT and PTGES proteins [ 68 ]. This sequence is annotated as “MSGT-like” but the predicted structure of CG1742 is nearly identical and displays an RMSD 1.15 Å over 152 residues when superimposed with PTGES. PTGES, earlier referred to as MGST1-L1[ 69 ] is a glutathione-binding protein, and residues R38, R70, E77, R110, Y117, R126, and Y130 of human PTGES are associated with enzymatic activity as well as binding to glutathione [ 66 , 70 ]. Structural superposition reveals that CG1742 has a fully conserved set of these key functional residues, (R40, R71, E78, R111, Y118, R128, and F132). With respect to the last residue, a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution is likely to be functionally equivalent as phenylalanine and tyrosine have side chains with a single aromatic ring of similar volume. Phenylalanine differs only in that it lacks the hydroxyl group in the ortho position on the benzene ring. Since previous studies suggest that the aromatic ring of Y130 is likely important for PGH2-binding, an analog for this structural element is provided by F132 [ 70 ]. Details of modeled fly candidate PTGES and its comparison with human PTGES are provided in  S1 Fig  and a similar format is followed for all the candidate orthologs identified. The second gene in this set, CG4086 (Suppressor of ref(2)P sterility (Su(P)),  NP_524116.2 ) encodes a 417 residue protein. CG4086 displays 42% identity and 62% similarity to the sequence of human prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2,  NP_079",
  "discussion": "Discussion A schematic of a putative  D .  melanogaster  eicosanoid synthesis pathway based on our analysis is shown in  Fig 3 . Notably, the pathway appears to account for a full complement of prostaglandin synthesis enzymes. A functional thromboxane synthesis pathway may also be present, as potential orthologs for thromboxane A synthase have been identified. However, given the structural and sequence similarity of TBXA synthase to the numerous functionally unrelated cytochrome P450 oxidase in the  D .  melanogaster  genome, speculation must be reserved pending experimental validation. 10.1371/journal.pone.0211897.g003 Fig 3 A theoretical eicosanoid synthesis pathway in  D .  melanogaster . A graphical overview of fly candidates in the putative pathway shown alongside the human enzymes as well as superposed with it. Boxed names represent the intermediates or end products (Red: Prostaglandins; Blue: Thromboxanes; Green: Leukotrienes; Yellow: HETEs). Enzymes for which orthologs could not be identified are represented by dashed ovals. The three candidate groups are marked next to the enzymes in a similar manner as  Table 1 : high-confidence (regular font; Group 1), mid-range ( underlined; Group 2 ), and distant ( italicized and bold font; Group 3 ). The existence of a leukotriene synthesis arm of the pathway could not be fully resolved since a thorough search of the  D .  melanogaster  genome has failed to identify a potential lipoxygenase, which is critical for the initial processing of the PUFA substrate into leukotriene intermediates. Interestingly, potential orthologs exist for each of the downstream leukotriene processing enzymes. Based upon our current understanding of the mammalian pathway, a functional lipoxygenase is necessary for HETE intermediates and the corresponding final products ( e . g ., lipoxins and other non-canonical eicosanoids) [ 110 ]. Our data challenges that view that  D .  melanogaster  lacks a functional eicosanoid synthesis pathway [ 110 – 112 ] and suggests that it may in fact possess potential orthologs for some or majority of the eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. These candidates may have thus far eluded detection because of high sequence divergence compared to the mammalian enzymes. However, the modeling results from our study, suggest that these candidates share the same overall fold and matches for the known or predicted catalytic residues. The prediction of eicosanoid synthesis enzymes may explain the  in vivo  effects of aspirin and prostaglandins in oogenesis [ 29 ] and possibly the existence of eicosanoid-like compounds in  D .  melanogaster  [ 27 , 28 , 113 ]. Our results however raise many questions: (a) What are the exact roles of individual enzymes; do they catalyze the reactions their structures predict they should? (b) What are the intermediate and final end products of the pathway? (c) What are the principal physiological events these intermediate and final biosynthetic products control and how similar are ",
