  "abstract": "As we aim to expand human presence in space, we need to find viable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources. Space biomining of the Moon, Mars and asteroids has been indicated as one of the promising approaches to achieve in-situ resource utilization by the main space agencies. Structural and expensive metals, essential mineral nutrients, water, oxygen and volatiles could be potentially extracted from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks using microbial-based biotechnologies. The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to space bioremediation, recycling of waste and to reinforce regenerative life support systems. However, the science around space biomining is still young. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations posed by the space environments.",

  "full_text": "Introduction As the goal for human space exploration moves farther from Earth, relying on a constant resupply of resources from Earth becomes less viable. In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) approaches have the aim of enabling sustainable exploration and settlement of space, by mitigating the need of importing goods and materials from Earth (NASA-ASEE  1992 ; Anand et al.  2012 ; Montague et al.  2012 ; Menezes et al.  2015b ; Verseux et al.  2016 ). Microbial-based biotechnologies and biomanufacturing approaches have demonstrated their high efficacy in several applications and may become a key component of future ISRU strategies (Brown et al.  2008 ; Slenzka and Kempf  2010 ; Montague et al.  2012 ; Verseux et al.  2016 ; Nangle et al.  2020 ; Volponi and Lasseur  2020 ; Berliner et al.  2021 ; Castelein et al.  2021 ; Keller et al.  2021 ). Minerals and metals will be necessary resources for construction, infrastructure and manufacturing. Water, oxygen, volatiles, essential nutrients for human nutrition and soil fertilization, are all elements which will be essential to establish self-sufficient settlements, and that could be obtained from extraterrestrial rocks (Cockell  2011 ). Mining of these resources will therefore be a priority for an extraterrestrial settlement. Microorganisms can be applied to these needs, extracting useful elements by a technique called biomining or bioleaching. Currently on Earth around 20–25% of copper and 5% of gold are extracted using biomining (Johnson et al.  2013 ). Bioleaching can provide economic and environmental advantages compared to other methods (Srichandan et al.  2019 ) and can be used as a complementary technique to extract trace metals from mine waste, or recover low-grade ores which cannot be treated by conventional methods (Bosecker  1997 ). Mining processes produce an enormous amount of waste low-grade rock material and mill tailings, which often still contain useful trace elements that cannot be further recovered by traditional methods. However, these can be accessible to small microbial cells, as an effect of specific types of metabolism (Blowes et al.  2003 ; Schippers et al.  2013 ; Johnson  2014 ; Jerez  2017a ). With the same principle, bioleaching techniques can be applied to the recycling of useful metals from secondary solid waste (Schippers et al.  2013 ; Johnson  2014 ; Jerez  2017b ). A good example is provided by the recovery of rare earth elements (REEs, Reed et al.  2016 ) or copper from electronic waste (Srichandan et al.  2019 ). Many advantages of biomining over traditional techniques on Earth also apply to space. For instance, biomining generally requires lower energy compared to traditional mining (Schippers et al.  2013 ), which will be an advantage in space, where resources are limited and many engineering constraints may be in place. Nevertheless, space conditions and available rock materials are different from those present on Earth and which are commonly used in terrestrial biomining. On one hand, traditional autotrophic and chemolithotrophic microbes used for terrestrial biomining do not need to rely on organic compounds as nutrients, which are very scarce in extraterrestrial environments, to grow (Johansson  1992 ; Fahrion et al.  2021 ). On the other hand, rocks present on celestial bodies of mining interest have very diverse compositions. In some cases (e.g., the Moon and some asteroids) sulphide-containing minerals are scarce compared to ore-grade sulphide minerals which are the focus of terrestrial biomining (Lewis  1992 ; Anand et al.  2012 ; Righter et al.  2017 ; Steenstra et al.  2018 ,  2020 ; Brounce et al.  2019 ,  2020 ). This poses restrictions on the possibility of directly transferring our current knowledge on bioleaching, which is mainly based on chemolithoautotrophic iron- and/or sulphur-oxidising microorganisms, to space. This review explores the topic of space biomining, discussing the main principles and feasibility, and analyses possible applications. We discuss limitations and highlight that, considering the materials available in space, it is necessary to expand our knowledge on organotrophic, cyanobacteria and community-based bioleaching mechanisms. Finally, we propose to consider the addition of biomining compartments to supply basic chemical requirements for Biological Life-Support Systems (BLSS), and vice versa. Space biomining principles When talking about space biomining for ISRU, the following three main questions have to be addressed: (1) What elements do we need to obtain for a given application? (2) Where can we find them? (3) Which mining strategy would work best (this could exclude biomining in some cases)? We will try to address these questions, to the best of our knowledge, in this section. Answering these questions can be complex, as it involves an interdisciplinary knowledge of the space conditions present on the planetary body we want to mine, the type of rocks and mineral compositions available (including their intrinsic leachability and toxicity), the engineering technologies and biotechnologies required, in-space operational approach (a thorough discussion on the requirements for life support systems and ISRU for space exploration, although focused on cyanobacteria-based structures, has been reported in Keller et al.  2021 ), and the appropriate microorganism(s) and its metabolism(s) (Averesch  2021 ). The situation becomes even more complicated when discussing asteroid biomining, given that the mined resources would likely not be used in situ, therefore requiring additional transport to the location of utilization (see Sect.  4.3 ). To answer the first question, elements of high interest from the space biomining perspective vary depending on the aim (Cockell  2011 ; Raafat et al.  2013 ). Generally speaking, elements and molecules of interest for the establishment of a human settlements are water, molecular oxygen, essential mineral nutrients (e.g., potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, sulphur), gaseous volatiles (e.g., hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, helium), structural metals such as iron, copper, nickel and vanadium, and elements useful for electronic devices such as silicon and REEs (Menezes et al.  2015a ,  b ). Some of these, especially volatiles, could be used to produce fuel or water (such as hydrogen, Klas et al.  2015 ). Of great economic interest are also elements as platinum group elements (PGE), gold, and silver, which are currently expensive. This list is not intended to be complete. It must be noted that many rocks in the Solar System would be regarded as low-grade ores, in respect to those considered suitable for mining on Earth (Cockell and Santomartino, in press). However, biomining on Earth is often used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings which cannot be easily treated by conventional methods (Bosecker  1997 ; Mishra and Rhee  2014 ; Klas et al.  2015 ). Growth, and in some cases bioleaching, of diverse microorganisms on extraterrestrial rocks or simulants have been demonstrated (Gronstal et al.  2009 ; Olsson-Francis and Cockell  2010 ; Kölbl et al.  2017 ; Metzger et al.  2020 ; Volger et al.  2020 ; Milojevic et al.  2021 ), suggesting that, with the appropriate selection of species or consortia and conditions, microbial interaction with extraterrestrial substrate is possible. Moreover, space biomining experiments have been already performed in space. These include BioRock (Cockell et al.  2020 ,  2021 ; Santomartino et al.  2020 ) and BioAsteroid (2020/2021, data analysis in preparation), both performed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and a preparative mission for BioRock (Byloos et al.  2017 ). Although not intended as fully scaled-up biomining experiments, they first demonstrated the feasibility of biomining in space using heterotrophic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi), and basalt or meteorite as substrates. Space conditions and effects on biomining Environments outside Earth show a variety of conditions which differ from those present on Earth’s surface. Their effects on microbial behaviour at different levels (e.g., growth, survival, resistance, virulence, biofilm formation) have been widely reported (reviewed in Horneck et al.  2010 ; Senatore et al.  2018 ), and still there is much yet to be understood (Cockell  2021 ). Space can be considered an umbrella term which includes a variety of environments, each one with its own characteristics. For the aim of this review, we will report the following conditions present in three different space environments of relevance for the space biomining perspective: Mars, the Moon and asteroids (Table  1 ). On asteroids, given their small mass, we can generally assume conditions equivalent to that of spaceflight beyond Earth’s Van Allen belts, as described below. Table 1 Conditions on Moon, Mars and asteroids that could influence space biomining, compared to those on Earth Condition Planetary body Mars Moon Asteroids Earth Gravity 0.38× g 0.16× g Micro to centigravity 1× g Ionizing radiations  ~ 20 µGy/hour (GCR, SEP)  ~ 13.2 µGy/hour (GCR, SEP) (GCR, SEP) 0.034–0.114 µGy/hour (Baumstark-Khan and Facius  2002 ) Atmosphere composition 95% CO 2 , 2.8% N 2 , 2.1% Ar, trace gases Negligible Absent 78% N 2 , 20.9% O 2 , 0.9% Ar, 0.04% CO 2 , trace gases Pressure 6.1 mbar 3 × 10 –15  bar Vacuum 1 bar (at sea level) Temperature − 153 °C to + 20 °C − 178 °C to + 124 °C Depends on the asteroid.

Minerals include plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, ilmenite, spinel and others. KREEP rocks Depending on the type.

GCR  galactic cosmic rays,  SEP  Solar energetic particles All the conditions described here assume that the biomining operation has access to liquid water, an essential requirement for life (Cockell  2021 ). Water must either be obtained on the body of interest or imported. Although this is critical for biomining operations, here we focus on the other environmental conditions within a biomining reactor that influence growth within a liquid environment. i. Gravity  Gravity is proportional to the mass of the celestial body under examination. As a consequence, gravities at the surface of Mars, the Moon and asteroids are lower than on Earth (9.8 m/s 2 , or 1× g ). Mars has a gravity regimen of 3.7 m/s 2  (~ 0.38× g ), the Moon 1.62 m/s 2  (~ 0.16× g ). Microgravity (µ g  or ~ 10 –6 × g ) is the gravity condition generally experienced in a spacecraft in a free trajectory (either in transit from one celestial body to another, or in orbit around one; Horneck et al.  2010 ; Zea et al.  2017 ; Huang et al.  2018 ). Gravitational levels at the surface of an asteroid depend on the mass and the irregularity of its shape. While for more massive objects such as Ceres (0.27 m/s 2 , or ~ 0.03× g ), now considered a dwarf planet, gravity may be slightly higher (centigravity, in fact), the majority of asteroids are expected to have a gravity regimen similar to microgravity (Klas et al.  2015 ). It has been reported that cells with a diameter of less than 10 µm, which is the case for bacteria, archaea and many fungi, are too small to be directly affected by gravity or the lack thereof (Pollard  1965 ; Horneck et al.  2010 ; Zea et al.  2017 ). Instead, the responses observed are likely to be the indirect effects of altered extracellular environment where mass transport to and from the cell is limited to Brownian motion, limiting nutrient availability and resulting in the build-up of metabolic by-products with respect to 1× g  (Bosecker  1997 ; Zea  2015 ; Zea et al.  2016 ). However, microbial structures, namely biofilms, can be orders of magnitude larger. While biofilm growth is well known to occur on spacecraft components during spaceflight (McLean et al.  2001 ; Zea et al.  2020 ), controlled experiments have not shown consistent results, as increase, decrease, and no changes on biofilms grown in microgravity with respect to controls on Earth have been reported (reviewed in Zea et al.  2018 ). However, the effects of gravity on microbe-mineral interaction have not been characterized yet and should be further investigated. BioRock, a recent space biomining experiment mentioned above, showed no difference in final cell concentrations for three biomining bacterial species after 3 weeks of growth under terrestrial, Martian and micro-gravity (Santomartino et al.  2020 ). This result suggests that space microbial biotechnologies, including biomining, could be indifferent to gravitational conditions. Nevertheless, various hardware settings and reactor volumes may lead to divergent results, and other microbial species could react differently. Furthermore, processes that require gravity (e.g. sedimentation) will be impacted by changes in gravitational conditions. ii. Radiation  Earth’s magnetosphere and atmosphere protect us on the surface from most of the radiation environment experienced in space. Beyond the Van Allen belts (Prölss  2004 ), usually referred to as ‘deep space’, a radiation environment, mostly consisting of (i) galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and (ii) Solar energetic particles (SEP), exists (Zeitlin et al.  2013 ; Zhang et al.  2020 ). In the case of the lunar surface, neutrons as secondary particles arising from the interaction of GCRs and SEP’s and the regolith may have an impact on biological systems that is yet unknown (Horneck et al.  2010 ; Klas et al.  2015 ; Zhang et al.  2020 ). Hence, biomining operations beyond the Van Allen belts (i.e., on the Moon, Mars, and asteroids) need to consider the higher radiation environment. A wide literature studied microbial response and resistance to high dose of space radiations, including long-term exposure experiments outside the ISS (Horneck et al.  2012 ). Many of these studies focused on resistance and survival after exposure in a dried or dormant state. Among the microorganisms that showed a higher resistance to space radiations we can find  Chrooccocidiopsis  (Cockell et al.  2005 ; Billi et al.  2019 ),  Bacillus subtilis  (Moeller et al.  2014 ; Ulrich et al.  2018 ; Nicholson and Ricco  2020 ) and  Deinococcus radiodurans  (Mattimore and Battista  1996 ; Minton  1996 ), and some fungi as  Aspergillus niger  (Cortesão et al.  2020 ). Many of these have been also tested for their biomining (Brandl et al.  1999 ; Rozas et al.  2017 ; Faraji et al.  2018 ; Giese et al.  2019 ) or biosorption (Liu et al.  2012 ; Jaafar et al.  2015 ) capacity, suggesting a possible role for biomining in space. It must be noted that some of the molecular mechanisms of radiation (and related stresses) tolerance require the entrance of the cell in a dormant state (e.g., endospore formation, desiccation). These may not be useful in a context of space biomining, in which metabolically active cells are required. Further research is, therefore, necessary to link these two fields of study, in order to understand the most suitable microorganisms or mechanisms for long-term biomining operations. iii. Atmosphere composition and pressure  Mars has a thin atmosphere, composed of approximately 95% of CO 2 , 2.8% of N 2 , 2,1% Ar, trace gases including oxygen (0.13%) and hydrogen (Franz et al.  2017 ), and dust, with an average pressure at the surface of 6.1 mbar (Haberle  2015 ). Lunar atmosphere (composed of argon, helium, neon, sodium, potassium, hydrogen, trace elements and dust), with a pressure at the surface of 3 × 10 –15  bar and an average abundance at the surface of 2 × 10 5  particles/cm 3 , is considered negligible (Stern  1999 ; Lawson et al.  2005 ). Asteroids, including Ceres, possess no atmosphere (Hughes  1994 , Table  1 ). From a biomining perspective, the absence of oxygen constitutes a clear problem for those applications requiring aerobic microorganisms. The majority of bioleaching mechanisms elucidated so far occur in aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, anaerobic bioleaching has been demonstrated for some bacteria, although the mechanisms are not fully understood yet (Singh and Cameotra  2015 ). In anaerobic reductive dissolution, Fe 3+  is used as electron acceptor.  A. ferrooxidans , for instance, can catalyse the reduction of Fe 3+  under anaerobic and acidic conditions, coupled with oxidation of a  c -type cytochrome (Ohmura et al.  2002 ; Hallberg et al.  2011 ; Johnson et al.  2013 ; Singh and Cameotra  2015 ; Marrero et al.  2020 ).  Shewanella onediensis , a facultative anaerobe, could extract iron from lunar and Martian simulants under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Castelein et al.  2021 ). Microorganisms with alternative types of metabolism, or bioengineering approaches, may also be used. More problematic may be the low pressure or, in the case of the Moon and asteroids, vacuum. Pressure is one of the parameters that can profoundly influence microbial proliferation, mostly due to desiccation and reduced gas concentration, and Martian atmospheric pressure is already too low to support most microbial growth (Schwendner and Schuerger  2020 ; Verseux  2020 ). The current lowest pressure recorded for microbial growth is 0.7 kPa (7 mbar; Schuerger and Nicholson  2016 ). Nevertheless, low-pressure vacuum is used in biotechnologies, including biomining (Gnida  2020 ), and a bioreactor using low-pressure Mars-similar gas composition was successfully developed for cyanobacterial growth (Verseux et al.  2021 ). This suggests that, with the appropriate adaptation and engineering, challenges posed by extraterrestrial atmospheric composition and pressure could be overcome not to limit biomining applications. Low pressure could, indeed, reduce the engineering requirements of bioreactors. iv. Temperature  Temperature can influence not only microbial growth, but also the availability of liquid water for medium growth. Considering the prohibitive space temperatures and variations, discussed below, any space biotechnological application will need to use temperature-controlled bioreactors. However, temperatures of biological-based processes are generally lower than those using chemical or physical processes (Johnson  2014 ), and bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches could improve biomining capacity at low temperatures in order to decrease energy requirements. Martian surface temperature undergo considerable variations, leading to values varying from − 153 to + 20 °C (Murphy et al.  1990 ; Haberle  2015 ). Due to the negligible atmosphere, surface temperature on the Moon varies between − 178 °C and + 124 °C (Williams et al.  2017 ). Asteroid surface temperatures depend on the distance from the Sun as well as from local differences in composition and topographic features, and they can vary largely among asteroids. On Ceres, surface temperatures oscillates between − 143 and − 73 °C, and similar conditions can be expected on smaller asteroids. For example, the highest surface temperature on asteroid 21 Lutetia, measured by Visible, InfraRed, and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on Rosetta, was − 28 °C (Coradini et al.  2011 ), and the surface temperature of Ryugu, measured by the Japanese Hayabusa2 orbiter, varies between − 50 °C and + 60 °C (Okada et al.  2020 ). In other words, on all extraterrestrial bodies known, temperatures tend to generally exceed the known limits to life, implying that biomining operations will need to be conducted under strict temperature control. v. Rock composition, regolith and minerals  Regolith and rock composition need to be taken into account when deciding which biomining microorganism or technique to use in a g",

  "conclusion": "Conclusions As the goal for space exploration expands toward establishing permanent settlements in space, space biomining is generating an increasing interest. The main space agencies have recognized its potential in their roadmaps. Many are the advantages, as terrestrial biomining is considered a sustainable approach in both the economic and environmental terms (Jerez  2017a ). Moreover, many rocks in the Solar System would be considered low-grade ores for terrestrial standards (Cockell and Santomartino, in press), and biomining on Earth is commonly used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings (Bosecker  1997 ; Mishra and Rhee  2014 ). The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to bioremediation, recycling of waste and to support BLSS. Although promising, the science around space biomining is still relatively young. Considering the differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions, including rock type and ore availability, a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be always possible. Energetic and metabolic demands need to be taken into account. Engineering requirements for space biomining reactors will require temperature controls, aeration and stirring under complex and harsh conditions. While most terrestrial biomining knowledge is based on autotrophic microorganisms able to break down sulphidic minerals without the need of carbon compounds, many rocks in the Solar Systems may present a low sulphur content. In these cases, heterotrophic microorganisms could be a better choice, but they would require organic compounds. Moreover, most bioleaching reactions are aerobic, and oxygen itself will be a commodity in space. A careful selection of the most appropriate techniques and microorganisms will be required for any given application, and the optimal solution could include complementary systems (Averesch  2021 ). Ethic and planetary protection discussions are outside of the aim of this review. Nevert"
