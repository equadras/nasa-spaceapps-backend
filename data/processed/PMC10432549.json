  "abstract": "The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms’ behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  were grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed.",

  "full_text": "Introduction In previous and current spaces stations (Salyut-6 and -7, Mir, and the International Space Station (ISS)), damage caused by bacterial biofilms on hardware have resulted in function disruption and failures of myriad equipment (summarized in Zea et al., 2018, 2020 1 , 2 ). On the ISS, biofilms are a concern for the water recovery system, particularly for the water processing assembly’s wastewater tank and its downstream filter 3 , 4 , as well as for the hoses linking the distillation assembly to the purge and fluid pumps, which have needed to be returned to Earth for unclogging and reprocessing before sent back to ISS (Y.A. Velez-Justiniano, personal communication, June 10, 2022). Biofilms are communities of microbes attached to each other and to surfaces which can cause damage to materials either directly by using it as food, or indirectly via their metabolic byproducts 5 , 6 . While pre-planned biofilms may enable useful processes in space 7 – 9 , uncontrolled growth—especially of opportunistic or pathogenic microbes—may have another deleterious effect for space missions: increased risk of infections to the crew. Microbial communities living as biofilms can have increased tolerance to disinfectants and antibiotics 10 , which may contribute to recurrent infections. On Earth, biofilms are associated with 65% and 80% of infectious and chronic diseases, respectively 11 . Materials can profoundly influence biofilm growth, and it is possible to design surfaces that either prevent microbial adhesion or that have antimicrobial properties. Antimicrobial surfaces include those with metallic nanoparticles with biocidal effects 12  and strongly oxidizing materials that destroy cell membranes 13 . However, biocidal surfaces have a critical failure mechanism when a layer of destroyed cells forms on the initial surface. This layer can provide a safe harbor for new microbes to colonize. Preventing initial adhesion of microbes via engineering of surface properties addresses this limitation. Surface roughness provides initial colonizers with favorable positions to adhere to a surface, and therefore smooth surfaces tend to be more successful at preventing adhesion 14 . Hydrophobicity is another property that is particularly focused on in the context of creating adhesion-free surfaces; however, the influence is a complicated one. In general, hydrophobic surfaces may cause greater initial attachment due to hydrophobic interactions between the surface and the cell membranes, but also allow larger detachment rates 14 . The fast pace of microbial adaptation and changes in gene expression also presents a significant challenge for creation of anti-biofouling materials. Microorganism behavior is significantly altered by the presence of different surfaces. For example, biofilm morphologies differ strongly across steel and polypropylene surfaces 15 , and gene expression is altered for microbes exposed to less habitable surfaces 16 , 17 . Therefore, even surfaces engineered to resist biofilms may not be immune to bacteria colonization. Biofilm growth in space stations and surface habitat components can decrease the probability of mission success and increase that of medical risks to the crew. Crewed missions to the Lunar surface and Mars, the latter requiring several years in space, warrant understanding of how biofilms grow differently in microgravity, as system functionality is of even higher importance when receiving spare parts from Earth or returning crew to Earth promptly is not possible. To address this, the NASA-funded Space Biofilms project was designed as described in Zea et al. 2018 1 , and prepared and performed on board the ISS as reported in Flores et al., 2022 18 . In brief, samples of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  UCBPP-PA14 (PA14) were sent to the ISS and biofilms were allowed to grow on different surfaces for either one, two, or three days at 37 °C. Equivalent biofilms grown on Earth at 1  g  were used as controls. The six material surfaces tested were stainless steel 316 (SS316), passivated SS316 (pSS316), a silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil as a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS) 19 , cellulose membrane, silicone, and silicone with a microtopography. Each condition tested had four replicates fixed in 4% PFA for morphology analysis, and other four preserved in RNAlater for gene expression analysis. Here, we report the morphological and transcriptomic results of SS316, pSS316, and LIS grown in nutrient-rich medium (to replicate wastewater); the rest are reported elsewhere 20 . SS316 and pSS316 were assessed given their common use for spacecraft components and for elements of the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), respectively. LIS was tested as a potential alternative for future spacecraft parts most susceptible to biofilm formation. SS316 is an iron alloy containing chromium, nickel, and molybdenum characteristic for its increased resistance to corrosion compared to iron 21 . The passivation of SS316 uses a nitric or citric acid treatment to eliminate iron from the surface and generate an oxide passive layer to prevent corrosion 22 . LISs are a class of textured surfaces that are stably impregnated with a lubricant (e.g., oils) to render the surface with super-slippery properties 19 , 23  (Fig.  1 ). The lubricant is held within the texture by capillary and intermolecular forces. A drop on LIS can exist in one of twelve different thermodynamic states depending on the properties of the solid texture, lubricant, droplet, and environment. Stable impregnation of the lubricant requires the contact angle of the lubricant on solid surface to be below a critical value set by the texture parameters. For the case of stable LIS, the texture tops can remain exposed or covered by a thin van der Waals lubricant film depending on the spreading coefficient of the lubricant on the solid surface (in the presence of droplet phase). A detailed discussion of the thermodynamic states, stable impregnation criteria, and droplet mobility are provided in Smith et al. (2013) 19 . Because a significant portion of the surface texture can stay submerged in the lubricant (except for texture tops) for stable LIS, these surfaces can achieve significant reduction in adhesion and have been shown to have remarkable antifouling properties 24 – 30 .

Scale bars are 400 nm. Results The biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage of biofilms formed on SS316 were not statistically different from those of biofilms grown on pSS316 ( α  = 0.05) at any incubation day (Supplementary Figure  1  and raw data in Supplementary Table  1 ). Similarly, no morphological differences were observed between biofilms formed on the two materials (Supplementary Figure  2 ) for either Earth-based or microgravity cultures. In addition, there were no differentially expressed genes (DEG) between SS316 and pSS316 biofilms in any conditions tested ( α  = 0.05) except for microgravity day 2 where pSS316 had 44 DEG (Supplementary Table  2 ). Based on this, SS316 and pSS316 were pooled into one “SS” data set which is hereon compared and contrasted to that of biofilms formed on LIS. Biofilm morphology and observations from the liquid cultures In 1  g , biofilms on SS grew throughout the surface with no marked boundaries, usually creating conglomerates that formed ‘mounts’ of biofilm with dispersed single cells in between (Fig.  2a ). Conversely, the few biofilms grown on LIS were restricted to certain areas with sharp edges, had a more compact appearance, and looked thicker (not significant) than those grown on SS (Fig.  2b ). In addition, the LIS surface showed individual cells or small multiple cell groups attached in random isolated areas and a thin layer of nucleic acids in the areas where there was no biofilm. Bacterial cells attached on LIS were often found growing in the perimeter or inside of a circle (as seen for 1-day-old biofilms on 1  g ) as well as small, connected clusters. Overall, biofilms on LIS seemed to be restricted to grow in smaller areas than on SS. Fig. 2 P. aeruginosa  biofilm morphology on SS and LIS in 1  g  or microgravity. Representative confocal microscopy images of 1-, 2-, and 3-day-old biofilms formed over SS and LIS. Nucleic acids were stained with PI (red) and lipids were stained with Green Biofilm (green). First row per material is a bottom slice image with side-view panels of a cross-section point in the biofilm (specific section marked by the orange lines). Second row per material is a volume view of the complete z-stack image. Images correspond to biofilms grown in 1  g  over  a  SS and  b  LIS, or for biofilms grown in microgravity over  c  SS and  d  LIS. Negative controls of the material surfaces, stained with both PI and Green Biofilm stains, are presented in panel ( e ). Scale bars are 20 µm. Biofilms form without boundaries on SS while on LIS they have sharp edges. Biofilms had significantly reduced surface area coverage on LIS, especially in microgravity where biofilms were minimized and mostly present as small groups of cells. The thin layer of nucleic acids on LIS surface could be DNA, RNA, or both as PI does not differentiate between them. The morphology of biofilms formed on SS in space was similar to that of the Earth controls, in that the space samples also exhibited a lack of clear boundaries and biofilm ‘mounts’ were also observed, albeit with bigger gaps between them (Fig.  2c ). Biofilms grown on LIS in microgravity did not form as many sharp, compact, and thick biofilms (only a few in smaller size) compared to those formed in 1  g  (Fig.  2d ). The thickness of these smaller biofilms decreased in time ( p  < 0.001). Most of the surface of LIS was covered with a thin layer of nucleic acids (red signal from the propidium iodide (PI) stain). The PI did not partition to LIS’s silicone oil in the absence of bacteria, nor did the Green Biofilm stain (green signal to label lipids) (Fig.  2e ) confirming that the signal on the biofilm samples corresponds to adsorbed nucleic acids on LIS’s surface. The PA14 liquid cultures in which the coupons were submerged became more turbid (turbidity correlation with viable cell count available in Supplementary Figure  3 ) for the microgravity set than for the 1  g  controls (not significant for SS day 1 and SS day 2). Specifically, for the samples cultured for three days, when OD 600  in microgravity had an increase of 41.3% for SS ( p  = 2.9e−08) and 23.4% for LIS ( p  = 0.0204) (Supplementary Figure  4  and raw data in Supplementary Table  3 ). In addition, it is worth noting that the color of the liquid culture changed as well. In microgravity, the cultures were light green on day 1, light brown on day 2, and light pink on day 3, while the ground cultures remained clear for days 1 and 2 and then turned light yellow on day 3 (Supplementary Figure  5 ). The increased culture turbidity in microgravity could suggest more bacterial growth in general; however, microgravity biofilms exhibited the opposite trend. Biofilm biomass, thickness, and surface coverage PA14 biofilms formed in microgravity had significantly lower ( p  ≤ 0.05) biomass (Fig.  3 ), and thickness (Fig.  4 ) than those formed at 1  g . This is true for both SS and LIS, the only exception being for the biofilms formed on LIS at one day of incubation, which exhibited no difference between gravitational regimes. In the case of SS, by day 3 biofilms formed in microgravity had only 17.6% and 53.6% of the ground control biomass and thickness, respectively. The same phenomenon was observed on LIS, where biofilms formed in space had 8.7% and 21.3% of the ground control biomass and thickness. Furthermore, biofilms formed in space covered significantly less surface than their 1  g  counterparts (31.4% and 33.0% of surface area for SS and LIS, respectively) (Fig.  5 ). The median values for the three parameters assessed are summarized in Table  1  and the raw data in Supplementary Table  4 . Fig. 3 P. aeruginosa  biofilm mass on SS and LIS in 1  g  or microgravity.

SS  stainless steel,  LIS  lubricant impregnated surface. The SS and LIS biofilms on 1  g  appeared to grow in size with time, with the largest growth observed between day 1 and day 2 (Figs.  2a, b ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ). This trend also held true for SS in microgravity; although with a lower growth rate (Figs.  2c ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ). For biofilms on LIS in microgravity, there was little to no change in mass and surface area coverage as a function of time. Biofilms grown on SS were significantly different than biofilms grown on LIS in terms of mass and surface area coverage. On both Earth and in microgravity, at day 3, the median of biomass and surface area coverage in LIS was significantly lower ( p  ≤ 0.001) than in SS biofilms (Table  1 ). Gene expression of biofilms in microgravity vs biofilms on 1  g Bacteria adapt to their environment through gene expression modulation. The mechanisms used by bacteria to adapt to changes can be observed in their transcriptomic profile. The following paragraphs compare 3-day-old biofilms formed in microgravity against matched Earth controls (baseline) for either SS or LIS surfaces. When available, the PAO1 ortholog gene numbers are listed in the brackets at the first mention of the corresponding PA14 gene. For SS, biofilms showed five DEG in microgravity with a fold change ≥2 (Fig.  6 a,  b , raw data in Supplementary Table  5 ). Three had increased expression ( rsmY  [PA0527.1],  rmf  [PA3049],  pchB  [PA4230]), and the remaining two had decreased expression in microgravity (PA14_63220 [PA4782], PA14_21970 [PA3249]). A KEGG pathways enrichment analysis was performed to understand at a bigger scale the more subtle changes (including the <2-fold changes) caused by microgravity (Supplementary Figure  6 ). No significant enrichments were found with >2-fold, but it showed the “nitrogen metabolism” pathway enriched (Supplementary Figure  7 ) in the space samples (1.02-fold). In addition, analyses were focused on genes involved in  P. aeruginosa  virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Despite  pchB  (2.2-fold) being the only gene in the virulome differentially expressed >2-fold, the other five genes involved in pyochelin production also had significant increased expression in microgravity for biofilms grown over SS (Fig.  6c ):  pchI  (1.4-fold) [PA4222],  pchE  (1.9-fold) [PA4226],  pchD  (1.5-fold) [PA4228],  pchC  (1.9-fold) [PA4229], and  fptA  (1.8-fold) [PA4221]. There was no significant effect >2-fold in the resistome. Fig. 6 Transcriptional differences between  P. aeruginosa  biofilms formed on SS in space with respect to Earth.

Sample F16.5 was not considered an outlier because the expression of the rest of the genes was similar to the other samples and no problems were found in the quality control steps.  n  = 7 biological replicates per gravitational condition. For LIS, biofilms in microgravity had only one DEG – PA14_08190 (−6.4-fold, raw data in Supplementary Table  6 )—which codes for a hypothetical protein. This suggests that biofilms on Earth and in space formed over LIS have virtually the same transcriptome. Futures tests in microgravity should confirm if this holds true at the protein level and should consider studying the function of PA14_08190. Gene expression of biofilms on LIS vs biofilms on SS The following paragraphs describe the results of the gene expression analyses performed to compare 3-day-old biofilms grown on LIS with respect to 3-day-old biofilms grown on SS (baseline). The first paragraph focuses on results under Earth’s gravity and the second paragraph for results in microgravity. On Earth, biofilms grown on LIS had 310 DEG with a fold change ≥2 (Fig.  7 a,  b , ra",

  "methods": "Methods Reagents and hardware The reagents and hardware were prepared as described in Flores et al. (2022) 18 . In brief, the PBS was prepared with PBS pellets (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P4417) and autoclaved. The 1X LBK medium was LB Lennox (Sigma, Cat. L3022) supplemented with 0.86% potassium nitrate (Sigma, Cat. P8291) and filter sterilized with 0.22 µm filters (Nalgene, Cat. 566-0020). LBK medium was prepared at 1.18X concentration to load in the hardware to account for dilution during experiment activation. The 11.4% PFA solution was prepared by diluting 16% PFA (Alfa Aesar, Cat. 43368) with PBS. When mixed with the sample it yields a final concentration of 4% PFA. The RNAlater (Invitrogen, Cat. AM7021) was refrigerated prior to loading it in the hardware to induce the formation of RNAlater crystals. These crystals were then pulverized and the RNAlater was loaded cold into the hardware. Preemptive formation and pulverization of the RNAlater crystals avoided the formation of long crystals during launch (4 °C) that could cause sample loss, early activation, and leaks by displacing the hardware chambers. After sample incubation, the RNAlater was still efficient at preserving RNA from biofilms 18 . BioServe’s FPA housed in the Group Activation Pack (GAP) were used as both ground and flight sample hardware. The FPA hardware components were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox, Cat. 1201-1), coated with sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. SL2), and dried at 100 °C for 30 min to siliconize the glass and facilitate sample assembly. Bacterial strain and Inoculum All the biofilm experiments were performed using  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  UCBPP-PA14 strain, which was kindly provided by Dr. George O’Toole. This strain was selected for the project to replicate the column-and-canopy biofilm structure previously observed in microgravity by Kim et al. (2013) 31  when growing PA14 biofilms over cellulose membrane. The results of the biofilms grown over cellulose membrane are reported in a separate publication 20 . The bacterial inoculum was prepared with 6 ml of LBK media inoculated with PA14 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h (final OD 595  0.706). The overnight inoculum was diluted 1:100 with PBS (final OD 595  0.001) to maintain cells in stasis. The diluted inoculum was used to load the second chamber of FPAs. Test surface preparation Biofilms were grown on 1 cm 2  material coupons of SS316 (MPPR-311-6), pSS316, and LIS. SS316 coupons were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox Cat. 1201-1). For the pSS316, clean SS316 coupons were passivated with citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. C-8385). Preparation of LIS coupons (silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil) has been described in detail previously 1 , 18 , 19 . LIS coupons were not cleaned, to avoid removing the silicone oil, but they were prepared in sterile conditions. LIS’s silicone oil layer (0.5–1.5 µm in thickness) has no bactericidal nor growth boost effect on  P. aeruginosa  PA14 18 . Sample preparation A total of 144 ",

Contrary to what has been previously reported for anaerobic  P. aeruginosa  PA14 biofilm growth in space 31 , we observed less robust biofilms in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage in microgravity with respect to 1  g . In microgravity, the increased expression of  rmf , in charge of ribosomal hibernation 32  during stationary phase 33 , could be indicative of a substrate-limited and byproduct-abundant extracellular environment for biofilms over SS, as the one theorized to occur in microgravity for non-motile planktonic cells 34 , 35 . Such an environment could be partially attributed to the increased planktonic cell growth in microgravity, increasing the accumulation of metabolic byproducts and depletion of nutrients, and potentially the cause of reduced biofilm formation. Proteomic analysis and functional analysis are needed to confirm these hypotheses. Starvation environmental conditions can trigger biofilm dispersal in  P. aeruginosa 36 , 37 . However, the genes known to be involved in biofilm dispersion 38 — dipA  [PA5017] 39 , 40 ,  rbdA  [PA0861] 41 ,  nbdA  [PA3311] 42 , 43 ,  gcbA  [PA4843] 44 , and  bdlA  [PA1423] 39 —were not differentially expressed in microgravity. Thus, biofilm dispersal could be regulated by other gene(s) in microgravity. Potentially, the increased planktonic growth and decreased biofilm formation are not a consequence of biofilm dispersion. For SS, the most DEG in microgravity was  rsmY . RsmY (small non-coding RNA) controls broad gene expression in  P. aeruginosa  through the sequestering of RsmA (gene repressor) 45 . RsmA targets the mRNAs of genes  mvaT  [PA4315],  pchB ,  pchC ,  pchD , and  pchE 46  and, those genes demonstrated increased expression in microgravity. We hypothesize that RsmY could be regulating some of the biggest transcriptional changes observed in biofilms grown over SS in microgravity. It is worth nothing that DEG PA14_63220 and PA14_21970 code for a hypothetical protein and a transcriptional regulator, respectively, that have not yet been characterized and whose functions could shed light to the changes observed in microgravity. Moreover, this could be specific for biofilms growing on SS, only for biofilms past microcolony stages, or both, as biofilms on LIS did not have increased expression of  rsmY  in microgravity. Our results suggest potential increased virulence of PA14 3-day-old biofilms on SS in microgravity through increased expression of pyochelin. Pyochelin is secreted to chelate iron for bacterial use 47  and the outer membrane receptor, FptA, internalizes it. In addition, pyochelin production in biofilms is characteristic of aggressive and chronic infections 48 , 49 . Proteomic tests should confirm these results at protein level and on different surfaces. The green, brown, and pink colors of the liquid culture in microgravity could be attri",
