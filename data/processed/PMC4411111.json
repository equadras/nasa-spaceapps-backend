We characterized  regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1  ( rbb1-1 ), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control.  rbb1-1  mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes.

  "full_text": "Introduction The lytic vacuole in vegetative cells may occupy more 90% of the cell volume. This essential organelle is highly dynamic and has critical functions in cellular homeostasis, maintenance of turgor, storage and recycling [ 1 – 3 ]. Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant membrane fluctuations and transient and highly mobile structures such as trans-vacuolar strands (TVS), sheets and bulbs [ 4 ,  5 ]. TVS are dynamic tubules delimited by the tonoplast that are thought to distribute cytoplasmic contents, including organelles between opposite sides of the cortical cytoskeleton [ 6 ]. In root hairs of  Hydrocharis dubia , TVS form predomindantly along the tip growing axis and are thought to deliver cytosolic components to the growing tip [ 7 ,  8 ]. Many TVS sorrounding the phragmoplast were also observed in tobacco BY-2 cells during cell division [ 9 ]. The actin cytoskeleton has been localized to TVS [ 10 ], and disruption of actin filaments results in their dissasembly [ 11 ]. Similarly, microinjection of antiserum against two actin-binding proteins of the villin group disrupted the TVS in root hair cells of  H .  dubia  [ 7 ,  12 ]. The current model for TVS formation is that the actomyosin system regulates TVS formation and dynamics [ 13 ,  14 ]. Bulbs are spherical structures of diameters between 1 and 10 μm that are highly dynamic in the lumen of the vacuole. These membrane structures are associated with the outer tonoplast membrane or transvacuolar strands and contain cytoplasmic structures, even organelles, between the folded membranes [ 5 ,  15 ]. Imaging by electron microscopy has indicated that bulbs are formed by multiple layers of tonoplast membranes, which explains the increased intensity of bulbs in fluorescently labeled tonoplasts [ 15 ]. Bulbs are present in LVs of cotyledon and leaf epidermis and their numbers decrease during cotyledon expansion [ 15 ], and leaf maturation [ 16 ]. Bulbs have been visualized by fluorescencence microscopy of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions with several tonoplast proteins and in multiple cell types. For example, in vacuoles of tobacco leaves, bulbs were observed when GFP-VAM3/SYP22 [ 17 ] or a GFP fusion with the phosphate transporter NPT2 [ 18 ] were transiently expressed. In Arabidopsis, bulbs have been detected in epidermis of the root elongation zone and the leaf, sepal bundle sheet, and germinating pollen of stably transformed plants expressing either GFP-AtVAM3 [ 5 ], TPK1-GFP [ 19 ,  20 ], TIP1;1-GFP [ 21 ], or FP fusions with other tonoplast intrinsic proteins [ 16 ,  22 ]. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate sensor 2xFYVE-YFP also labels the bulbs [ 23 ]. These structures are not simply the result of ectopic expression of FP fusions because they were also detected in Arabidopsis WT plants by electron microscopy [ 15 ]. It was recently proposed that bulbs may form by dimerization of GFP or YFP tags when fused to tonoplast markers, and that some of these structures may be artifacts from this interaction [ 24 ]. Two types of structures were distinguished: bulbs associated with high levels of expression of GFP fusions that showed 3 or more fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the tonoplast, and “intra-vacuolar spherical structures” (IVSPs) present in transgenic lines in which the intensity of fluorescence was only two fold that of the tonoplast and were visualized with a non-dimerizing GFP molecule. This distinction was most dramatic in the root elongation zone where only very bright bulbs were observed, but it was more complex in other tissues, such as the cotyledon epidermis, where both types of structures existed [ 24 ]. Two hypotheses for the function of bulbs have been proposed. Bulbs may act as reservoirs of membranes for cell expansion or they may represent the first step for proteolysis of tonoplast proteins inside the vacuole [ 15 ,  19 ]. Only two mutants with bulb phenotypes have been identified thus far. These are  sgr2-1  and  vti11 , and in both cases these mutants show a reduced number of bulbs [ 23 ]. SGR2 encodes a protein similar to phospholipase A1, and  sgr2  mutants have an abnormal vacuole morphology with multiple small vacuole-like structures and abnormal distribution of the vacuole and the cytosol in shoot endodermal cells [ 25 ]. VTI11 encodes a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein that mediates membrane fusion between pre-vacuolar compartments and the vacuole [ 26 ,  27 ]. VTI11 is also involved in vacuole homotypic fusion, and  vti11  mutant alleles have highly fragmented vacuoles [ 28 ]. Given the highly abnormal vacuole morphology of these two mutants, it is unclear if the lack of bulbs is a direct or indirect effect of the loss of SGR2 and VTI11. Here we describe the phenotype of  regulator of bulb biogenesis1  ( rbb1-1 ), a novel mutant in Arabidopsis that displays increased numbers of bulbs in otherwise normal vacuoles. We show that  rbb1-1  mutants make fewer TVS than the parental control. We propose the hypothesis that RBB1 may function in TVS formation and that increased bulb accumulation in  rbb1-1  may result from impaired formation of TVS. In addition, we show that the differential labeling of bulbs between  rbb1-1  and the parental line does not result from abnormal trafficking to the vacuole. We also identified  RBB1  locus, which encodes a large plant-specific protein of unknown function. Materials and Methods Plant Material and Growth Conditions The parental line carrying GFP-TIP2;1 and mCherry-HDEL [ 29 ], and the marker lines TIP1;1-YFP [ 16 ] and SYP22-RFP [ 30 ] were previously described. SALK_095160, SALK_067590 and SALK_074387 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR. pUBQ10::RFP-TIP1;1 was generated by Gateway cloning (Invitrogen). Briefly, the TIP1;1 CDS was amplified from Col-0 cDNA by PCR and the amplicon was introduced into pENTR-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A RFP-TIP1;1 expression clone was generated by recombination with pUBN-RFP [ 31 ] using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). The promoter of the resulting construct was substituted with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (Geldner et al 2009) to generate  pUBQ10 :: RFP-TIP1;1 . The  RBB1 :: 3xYpet-RBB1  and  RBB1 :: RBB1-3xYpet  constructs were generated by a Recombineering-based gene tagging system [ 32 ] using the JAtY76M24 clone and the primers listed in  S1 Table . After introducing 3xYpet, the JAtY clone was shortened by homologous recombination using \"delleft\" and \"RB-amp\" primers ( S1 Table ). This resulted in a fragment of the chromosomal region containing 12.8 kb upstream of start codon of  RBB1  and up to 5 kb downstream from the stop codon. These constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101 and then transformed into Col-0 wild type plants via floral dip [ 33 ]. Seeds were plated on AGM (0.5X MS media and 1% sucrose) with 4 g /L GelRite. For light-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated for 4 days in the dark to break dormancy and then incubated at 22°C under a 16 h light photoperiod. For dark-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated in the dark and then incubated at 22°C while covered in aluminum foil. Chemical Stocks and Treatments C834 (ID 6982834) was from Chembridge, Brefeldin A from Sigma and Lysotracker Red and FM4-64 from Invitrogen. All chemicals were dissolved in 100% DMSO and all treatments were carried out with 4-day old seedlings, unless specified. BFA treatment was done in liquid AGM containing 75 μM BFA and for 3 h. C834 treatment was done with 3-d-old seedlings in solid AGM-GelRite supplemented with 55μM C834 for 48 hours as described [ 29 ]. For staining, seedlings were incubated in liquid AGM containing 2 μM Lysotracker Red for 2 h or 5 μM FM4-64 for 5 min. Microscopy A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for all imaging experiments. A 40x water objective (1.1 N.A.) was used to image embryos and roots. A 20x objective (0.8 N.A.) was used to image hypocotyls and cotyledons. The excitation/emission wavelengths during acquisition were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and Ypet, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and RFP, 514 nm/588–700 nm for FM4-64, and 561 nm/566-690 nm for Lysotracker red. To count the number of TVS, seedlings were imaged using a large pinhole to generate 600 μm thick optical sections for hypocotyls and 102 μm sections for cotyledons. A 40X objective was used and image zoom was kept at 0.6. Epidermal cells within the bottom half of the hypocotyl, but excluding the root-shoot junction, were used for TVS counting in hypocotyls. Epidermal cells from the adaxial side were used for cotyledons. TVS were counted in each cell from the collected images. RT-PCR Total mRNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (NEB). cDNA was synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) and was used a template for RT-PCR. Oligo sequences used for PCR are shown in  S2 Table  and 30 cycles were used for all reactions. Map-based cloning and genome sequencing A mapping population was generated from a cross between  rbb1-1  and the L er  wild type background, and segregating homozygous  rbb1-1  mutants were identified based on the bulb phenotype. Two Single Sequence Length Polymorphism (SSLP) markers [ 34 ] co-segregated with the  rbb1-1  phenotype and placed the mutation in Chromosome 5. For SNP detection, 12 homozygous F 3  families from 1 backcross to the parental line were selected based on the bulb phenotype and 500 seedlings per family were used to generate DNA libraries. Samples were sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq sequencer as 100 bp reads at BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute). The expected genome coverage was 35X. Data analysis was carried out at the Bioinformatics Consulting and Service Core at North Carolina State University as follows. Sequence reads were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using bowtie2 and variant calls were made using samtools mpileup. Variants were filtered for those located within TAIR10 genes and data was exported to a spreadsheet. Only SNPs located between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD in Chromosome 5 were analyzed further. From these, mutations that were originally present in the parental line were identified from the sequencing of an unrelated mutant from the same mutagenesis screen. In addition, mutations in introns or UTRs, silent mutations and mutations unlikely to result from EMS mutagenesis were discarded. Western Blot Total proteins were extracted from 7 day-old seedlings. Samples were homogenized in 50mM HEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 8% sucrose, 1mM DTT and proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics) in a chilled mortar. The homogenates were spun at 5,000g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was filtered through 3 layers of miracloth. For membrane protein fractions (P100), filtered total proteins were spun at 100,000g for 1 h at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in buffer. Protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford assay. For immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1, 8 μg of proteins were loaded in a NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate gel (Life Technologies) following manufacturer instructions. The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP (Thermo MA5-15256), anti-cFBase (Agrisera AS04043), anti-H + ATPase (Agrisera AS07260) and anti-calreticulin [ 35 ]. Peroxidase-Conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Thermo 32430) or peroxidase-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit (Thermo 32460) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ system (Syngene) for image capture. Signal was quantified using the GeneTools image analysis software (Syngene). Results GFP-TIP2;1 labels excess bulbs in  regulator of bulb biogenesis1 \n We recently carried out a screen for mutants in tonoplast protein trafficking and vacuole biogenesis and characterized the function of the VTI11 SNARE protein and phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion [ 28 ]. During the course of this work, we identified a mutant in which the tonoplast protein GFP-TIP2;1 labeled many vacuolar bulbs and it was named  regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1  ( rbb1-1) . In the parental line, the GFP-TIP2;1 protein labels the tonoplast and very few bulbs in root epidermis and cortex and the epidermis of hypocotyls, cotyledons and rosette leaves ( Fig 1A–1D ) [ 16 ,  28 ,  36 ]. In the  rbb1-1  mutant, GFP-TIP2;1 also labels the tonoplast, and the size and morphology of the vacuole appeared normal. However, many more bulbs were evident as bright sub-vacuolar structures in multiple tissues ( Fig 1E–1H ). In hypocotyls, bulbs were observed consistently in many cells in the epidermis and cortex ( Fig 1E ). Bulbs were also apparent in high numbers in the epidermis of cotyledons and rosette leaves of  rbb1-1  ( Fig 1F and 1H ). Vacuolar bulbs were detected in roots ( Fig 1G ), but this phenotype was variable amongst different seed stocks and was not characterized further. The variability in the root phenotype may be due to root-specific modifying factors that segregate in the population. No major defects in plant morphology were detected in  rbb1-1  homozygous plants ( S1 Fig ). Sequencing demonstrated that the  GFP-TIP2;1  transgene is intact in  rbb1-1  and consequently, the bulb phenotype is not related to a mutation in the GFP-TIP2;1 protein sequence. 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g001 Fig 1 \n regulator of bulb biogenesis1  contains many bulbs in many cell types. (a-h)  rbb1-1  mutants have more bulbs than the parental line. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in the parental line (WT, a-d) or  rbb1-1  (e-h). Four-day-old seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize morphology of the vacuole in the epidermis of hypocotyl (a, e) and cotyledon (b, f), and in root epidermis and cortex (c, g). The bulb phenotype was also observed in rosette leaves of 6-week-old plants (d, h). Scale bar = 20 μm. (i-n) GFP-TIP2;1 and RFP-TIP1;1 co-localize in  rbb1-1  bulbs.

Merged images (k, n) are also shown. Scale bar: 20 μm. (o)  rbb1-1  mutants do not accumulate higher levels of GFP-TIP2;1 in seedlings. Immunoblot of GFP-TIP2;1 accumulation in the parental line and  rbb1-1  using antibodies against GFP (α-GFP) and Calreticulin (α-CRT) as loading control. TIP1;1-YFP is often found in vacuolar bulbs [ 16 ,  23 ,  37 ]. In order to determine if the  rbb1-1  bulbs accumulate TIP1;1 in a similar manner, we introduced a RFP-TIP1;1 fusion in the  rbb1-1  mutant background. In the parental line, RFP-TIP1;1 localized to the tonoplast, and labeled very few bulbs in roots and hypocotyls ( Fig 1I–1K ). RFP-TIP1;1 co-localized with GFP-TIP2;1 in the tonoplast and the bulbs when the two markers were co-expressed in  rbb1-1  ( Fig 1L–1N ). It was previously proposed that vacuolar bulbs are involved in the degradation of membrane proteins [ 19 ] and that bulbs may form as a response to overexpression of dimer-type FP [ 24 ]. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs in  rbb1-1  could be caused by enhanced accumulation of GFP-TIP2;1 in  rbb1-1  by Western blot. No significant differences in GFP-TIP2;1 protein accumulation were detected between  rbb1-1  and the parental control, indicating that the increased number of bulbs in  rbb1-1  is not related to differences in protein accumulation or stability ( Fig 1O  and  S1C Fig ). These results overall indicate that, independent on the nature of the bulbs in  rbb1-1 , the  RBB1  locus is required to prevent the formation or accumulation of bulbs in the vacuole. In order to compare  rbb1-1  bulbs with the IVSPs and bulbs previously described [ 24 ], we measured the maximum intensity values for bulb membranes in  rbb1-1 . As shown in  S2 Fig , maximum intensity values for the bulbs in the parental line are 1.2- and 1.3-fold higher than the outer tonoplast in cotyledons and hypocotyls, respectively. In contrast,  rbb1-1  bulbs have 2 fold higher intensity than the tonoplast in hypocotyl, and 3.5-fold higher in cotyledons. Therefore,  rbb1-1  bulbs would fit the description of both IVSPs and bulbs [ 24 ]. Moreover, given the fact that the GFP-TIP2;1 protein levels in  rbb1-1  mutants is similar to the parental line, we conclude that the  rbb1-1  bulbs are not simply the result of increased GFP dimerization in the mutant. However, we can not discard the possibility that GFP dimerization acts as an enhancer of the  rbb1  phenotype. Given the complexity of these structures, we will refer to them here simply as bulbs. The vacuole membrane in many plant species constantly remodels with the formation of transvacuolar strands (TVS). We then hypothesized that the mechanisms involved in bulb formation and the dynamics of TVS may be related and that  RBB1  may have a role in TVS formation. In order to test this possibility, we compared the number of TVS between the parental line and  rbb1-1  mutants. In contrast to the parental line, which shows 4.06 ± 0.39 TVS per cell in cotyledon epidermis,  rbb1-1  mutants have only 1.40 ± 0.16 ( Fig 2A  and  S3A and S3B Fig ). Therefore,  rbb1-1  has ~3-fold fewer TVS than the parental line, and this result provides support to a hypothesis that RBB1 is involved in TVS formation. This phenotype was also observed in the hypocotyls of light- and dark-grown seedlings. Thus, the parental line showed an average of 2.2 ± 0.2 TVS per cell in the light and 1.75 ± 0.21 in the dark, while the  rbb1-1  mutant had 1.25 ± 0.15 and 1.03 ± 0.19, respectively ( Fig 2B ). This indicates that  rbb1-1  had a 40% reduction in the number of TVS per cell in hypocotyls in both light and dark-grown seedlings. These results point towards important roles of RBB1 in the remodeling of the vacuole that generates either bulbs or TVS. 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g002 Fig 2 \n rbb1-1  mutants have fewer transvacuolar strands. (a) The number of trans-vacuolar strands (TVS) per cell was counted in cotyledon cells from the parental line and  rbb1-1  seedlings that were grown in the light. n = 48 cells from 8 seedlings. (b)  rbb1-1  mutants have fewer TVS in hypocotyl from light- and dark-grown seedlings. Seedlings were germinated in the light or dark for 4 days and TVS were counted. n = 60 cells from 10 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P ≤ 0.05). The  rbb1-1  phenotype can be detected 3 days post-germination In order to characterize the developmental progression of the bulb phenotype in  rbb1-1 , vacuoles were visualized at different times during seed germination ( Fig 3A–3J ). No bulbs were observed in PSVs of imbibed seeds or 1 d after incubation at 22°C in either the parental line or  rbb1-1  ( Fig 3A, 3B, 3F and 3G ). Bulbs were first detected at day 2 post-germination in both the parental line and  rbb1-1  when the large lytic vacuole is already established [ 16 ]. The bulbs were very transient in the parental line and very few were observed at 3 days or later. In contrast, the number of bulbs in  rbb1-1  continued to increase at days 3 and 4. These results indicate that  RBB1  function may be important after day 3, but not during the early stages of germination. 10.1371/journal.pone.0125621.g003 Fig 3 Developmental progression of the  rbb1-1  phenotype and effects from light.

In order to determine if the  rbb1-1  bulbs accumulate TIP1;1 in a similar manner, we introduced a RFP-TIP1;1 fusion in the  rbb1-1  mutant background. In the parental line, RFP-TIP1;1 localized to the tonoplast, and labeled very few bulbs in roots and hypocotyls ( Fig 1I–1K ). RFP-TIP1;1 co-localized with GFP-TIP2;1 in the tonoplast and the bulbs when the two markers were co-expressed in  rbb1-1  ( Fig 1L–1N ). It was previously proposed that vacuolar bulbs are involved in the degradation of membrane proteins [ 19 ] and that bulbs may form as a response to overexpression of dimer-type FP [ 24 ]. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs in  rbb1-1  could be caused by enhanced accumulation of GFP-TIP2;1 in  rbb1-1  by Western blot. No significant differences in GFP-TIP2;1 protein accumulation were detected between  rbb1-1  and the parental control, indicating that the increased number of bulbs in  rbb1-1  is not related to differences in protein accumulation or stability ( Fig 1O  and  S1C Fig ). These results overall indicate that, independent on the nature of the bulbs in  rbb1-1 , the  RBB1  locus is required to prevent the formation or accumulatio",
  "discussion": "Discussion We have identified  rbb1-1 , a novel mutant with defects in vacuole morphology. Vacuoles in  rbb1-1  contain increased numbers of bulbs in the large central vacuole of cotyledons and hypocotyl cells when compared to the parental control. These defined vacuolar sub-structures can be visualized with fluorescent protein markers for the tonoplast [ 15 ,  23 ]. It was recently proposed that bulbs, specially when they have more than double the intensity of fluorescence when compared to the tonoplast, are artifacts that result from GFP dimerization that stabilizes the adhesion of tonoplast membranes [ 24 ]. This model, however, does not explain the accumulation of bulbs in the 2xFYVE-YFP line in which the fusion protein associates with the membrane in a reversible manner by binding to a specific phosphoinositide [ 15 ,  23 ,  50 ]. The GFP-TIP2;1-labeled bulbs in  rbb1-1  showed between 2 and 3.5-fold higher fluorescence intensity when compared to the tonoplast, indicating that they are likely to have a similar structure as previously characterized IVPS and bulbs [ 15 ,  23 ,  24 ]. We can not discard the possibility that the GFP fusion enhances the stability of the bulbs in  rbb1-1 , but  rbb1  mutant alleles comprise a sensitized genetic background for studying the formation and regulation of these structures, which are quite elusive under normal conditions. The two other mutants that have been identified as having abnormal bulb accumulation,  sgr2  and  vti11 , have fewer bulbs, also have very abnormal vacuole morphology [ 23 ,  25 ,  28 ]. Hence,  rbb1-1  is a unique tool to characterize the structure and function of the bulbs in the absence of other vacuolar defects. \n RBB1  encodes a very large protein with unknown molecular function. In order to determine the function of  RBB1 , we generated a 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein under the control of the  RBB1  promoter. This construct complemented the  rbb1-2  mutant phenotype indicating that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional. In seedlings, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in the root in the elongation and differentiation zones, but not in the cell division zone, and in hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells. Therefore, 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in cells that contain a large lytic vacuole [ 51 ], consistent with a role of RBB1 in regulating the morphology of this important organelle. Confocal scanning laser microscopy with the 3xYpet-RBB1 line indicated that this protein accumulates in the cytosol, and that in a few instances also co-localizes with Lysotracker red, a fluorescent dye that labels the tonoplast. RBB1 was found both in the soluble and membrane fractions by fractionation experiments, which raises the possibility that RBB1 may associate with membranes. 3xYpet-RBB1 was often present at the tips of elongating TVS in cotyledons and leaves, but visualization of a GFP control indicated that this localization may be detected some times with other cytosolic proteins. We detected a significant dec",
