  "abstract": "Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of  Brassica rapa  and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of  PIN1 ,  PIN3 ,  IAA5  and  ARG1  in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 ( UBQ1 ) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.",

  "full_text": "1. Introduction Gravitropism is defined as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-filled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination. Seedling roots grow towards gravity (aka positive gravitropism) and stems exhibit negative gravitropism and grow in the opposite direction. Although hypocotyls eventually respond as negatively gravitropic, we have previously shown that young hypocotyls of  Brassica rapa  and other dicotyledonous plants exhibit positive gravitropism. This reorientation is independent of the root cap and amplifies the root graviresponse [ 1 ]. The mechanism of this atypical, early curvature has not yet been studied. Based on the hypothesis that this curvature is auxin dependent, we investigated the transcription profile of auxin-responsive genes in the curving hypocotyl tissue. The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main growth regulator in plants that affects differential elongation [ 2 ] and is the main agent in complex processes that includes transport [ 3 ], and interaction with other phytohormones [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]. Auxin effects depend on metabolic activity [ 7 ], cytoskeletal interaction [ 8 , 9 ], ions [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ], and light [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ]. Auxin regulates primary and lateral root growth [ 19 , 20 ], branching [ 21 ], and differentiation [ 22 ]. The coordinated response to the integrative effect of these factors determines the rate and degree of curvature. Therefore, differential growth responses depend on auxin-mediated processes and gene expression. Auxin is synthesized predominantly in meristematic tissue such as shoot and root apices [ 23 ], developing seeds [ 24 ] and young leaves [ 25 ] and transported away from the site of synthesis. Auxin originating from the shoot apex is basipetally (rootward) transported to the stem tissue and basal leaves. In roots, auxin moves through the stele towards the root apex and is redistributed such that basipetal, shootward, transport takes place from the root tip through cortical tissue. The bi-directional auxin transport in roots forms the basis of the “reverse fountain model” [ 2 ]. The gravisensitive re-distribution of auxin in roots is initiated by amyloplast relocation and depends on PIN proteins. These proteins determine the direction of IAA flow based on their localization in the plasma membrane [ 26 ]. PIN proteins represent a family of proteins that are expressed in specific tissues [ 27 ]. PIN1 is typically present in xylem associated cells in shoots and roots [ 23 ] and is essential for efflux of the auxin anion from vasculature to root apices via protophloem cells [ 28 , 29 ]. In roots, PIN3, 4, and 7 are localized on the plasma membrane of different tiers of columella cells [ 30 ]; they direct the auxin flow from columella cells to the root cortex. PIN3 and PIN7 move to the plasma membrane along the lower side of columella cells in horizontally reoriented roots [ 31 ], which results in asymmetrical auxin transport. PIN4 in the quiescent center mediates auxin efflux towards the columella cells [ 32 ]. The auxin sink in the root cap contributes to the asymmetric auxin distribution in reoriented roots [ 33 ]. Polar localization of PIN2 in the plasma membrane of the lateral root cap and epidermal cells directs the auxin flow toward the cortical and epidermal cells [ 34 , 35 ]. Any auxin asymmetry leads to differential growth in the elongation zone [ 36 ]. In hypocotyls, sedimenting amyloplasts are found in the endodermis [ 37 , 38 ], which acts as gravisensing layer in dicots and is essential for the graviresponse [ 39 , 40 , 41 ]. PIN3 is expressed in the endodermis [ 28 ] and localizes laterally after two minutes of gravistimulation [ 42 ]. PIN3 localization is auxin dependent [ 43 ] and a mutation in the  PIN3  gene affects differential growth [ 42 ]. Hence,  PIN3  is an important factor for shoot graviresponse [ 43 ]. The  PIN3  homologs  PIN4  and  PIN7  are not expressed in the shoot endodermis and their mutants do not affect the shoot graviresponse [ 43 ]. Along with PIN proteins, Altered Response to Gravity (ARG1) is required for the localization of PIN3 during the early stages of hypocotyl graviresponse [ 44 ]. A mutation in  ARG1  affects early gravisignaling in roots and hypocotyls [ 45 ] but can be corrected by the expression of ARG1 in the endodermis of hypocotyls and root caps, which implies that it functions in statocytes [ 46 ]. PIN1 re-localization alters the lateral redistribution of auxin and affects the phototropic [ 47 ], and gravitropic response [ 48 ] and  PIN1  mutants show reduced polar auxin transport (PAT) in  Arabidopsis thaliana  inflorescence axes [ 49 ]. Another Auxin Response Element promotes  IAA5 , a member of Aux/IAA gene family, which has been identified as one of the early and primary response genes [ 50 , 51 ] that are governed by auxin [ 52 ].  Based on these auxin networks, we chose to compare the transcription levels of  PIN1 ,  PIN3 ,  IAA5  and  ARG  in vertically and horizontally reoriented hypocotyls of  Brassica rapa . Since Ubiquitin (UBQ) is highly expressed [ 53 ] and used as a reference gene [ 54 , 55 , 56 ], its transcription level was used as a reference to assess changes in the transcription of auxin responsive genes.  Despite many studies on PAT in hypocotyls and on effects of auxin on gene expression [ 57 , 58 ] during graviresponse [ 59 ], spatio-temporal differences in gene regulation during hypocotyl curvature have not been studied. Typically, total RNA is extracted by pooling the samples from the same region from several seedlings, which prevents the assessment of gene transcription at precise locations in the tissue/region under consideration. High spatial resolution is desirable as size, age and development is likely to affect transcription and expression profiles [ 60 ]. In addition, auxin-induced transcription is likely to follow a temporal profile that cannot be assessed by destructive sampling methods. We used Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) [ 59 , 61 ], which relies on mRNA binding to functionalized probes and allows for the repeated sampling of tissue. The temporal and spatial changes of transcription profiles during the initial hypocotyl curvature indicate an auxin-based regulation of positive and negative hypocotyl curvature. 2. Results 2.1. Time Course of Curvature As reported earlier [ 1 ], dicotyledonous plants such as Brassica, Radish and Flax show a bi-phasic and combined graviresponse of the root-shoot axis. The time course of curvature involves a transient curvature of the root tip. Upon straightening of the tip, the hypocotyl base begins to respond as positively gravitropic. The graviresponse is completed after about 20 h. The sampling intervals were chosen to coincide with the onset of hypocotyl curvature (four hours after reorientation), the midpoint of curvature (45-degree curvature of the hypocotyl; 11 h) and vertically oriented seedlings (48 h after the initial reorientation). 2.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction, Yield, and Reference RNA extraction of tissue was performed along the upper and lower flank of the basal hypocotyl from tissue extraction or by Solid Phase Gene Extraction ( Figure 1 ). The average cDNA yield was based on the amount of cDNA after reverse transcription. The tissue extraction (258 ± 16 µg) was significantly higher ( p  < 10 −10 ) than the yield from SPGE probes (0.654 ± 0.024 µg). Nonetheless, reliable qPCR experiments of SPGE samples were possible. Although UBQ1 transcription was not steady ( Figure 2 ), the changes were small in comparison to auxin-sensitive genes and UBQ1 transcription between the upper and lower flank remained similar ( p  = 0.75) throughout the experimental period ( Figure 3 ); therefore, UBQ1 is an acceptable reference gene. 2.3. Transcription in the Hypocotyl Base Tissue The transcription of auxin related genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were similar on the left and right flanks of vertically oriented hypocotyls ( Figure 4 ) but changed after horizontal reorientation. PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were downregulated along the top flank but upregulated in the bottom tissue. PIN1 transcription did not change during the first four hours but after 11 h of reorientation increased in the lower flank and decreased along the upper flank. At that time, all genes showed maximal changes in transcription activities ( Figure 5 ). The transcription analysis by SPGE showed similar profiles as the tissue data. The downregulation of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 along the top coincided with upregulation along the lower flank ( Figure 6 ) four and 11 h after reorientation. After 48 h, when the hypocotyl approaches vertical position, this trend of transcription expression was reversed, i.e., transcription was upregulated in the upper flank and downregulated in the lower flanks. SPGE sampling showed the largest difference in transcription at the point of the maximum curvature (probe #2 and #5,  Figure 1 ) compared to the adjacent positions after four and 11 h. The ratio of the fold change over time of all genes at position five vs. two varied by gene and showed the smallest signal after 48 h ( Figure 6 ). Considering the transcription for probe two and five (the points of maximal curvature on the convex and concave flank, respectively, for different time points showed that after four hours, the ratio for PIN1 and ARG1 was similar. IAA5 transcription was twice as high at the bottom (#5) than top (#2) position. At 11 h, PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 showed similar values for the convex and concave sites. The polarity of IAA5 was less, but still reached about five times the value of the top flank. After 48 h, the values were reversed and the polarity for PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 between the top and bottom side was about six to eight-fold; the polarity for IAA5 was weaker. These data show that after reversal of the curvature the transcription of the examined genes reached a comparable but reversed polarity as after 11 h. 2.4. Tissue and SPGE Extraction The average of the transcription values of all three SPGE probes on either flank was compared with corresponding tissue data of the lower and upper flank. The SPGE values for all examined genes were similar or slightly higher than the tissue values. The overall profile for all tested genes was comparable for both methods, i.e., upregulation along the bottom flank and downregulation in the upper side until 11 h after reorientation ( Figure 7 ). Consistently, this trend was reversed after 48 h. The transcription of all genes showed the greatest variability 11 h after reorientation, consistent with the onset of curvature reversal from positive to negative. 2.5. Comparison of the Hypocotyl and Root Tip As illustrated [ 1 ], the hypocotyl responds to gravity in sequentially positive and then negative curvature. In contrast, the root tip always exhibits positive gravicurvature. Therefore, a comparison of both tissues shows the extent and magnitude of synchronous changes in the transcription of relevant genes. ARG1 showed the highest transcription value compared to the other examined genes ( Figure 8 ). The transcription of all genes increased strongly at four hours followed by a gradual increase at 11 h after reorientation. SPGE showed upregulation for both PIN1 and ARG1 at all times after reorientation. PIN3 transcription remained constant until four hours after reorientation, followed by continued but reduced upregulation. Although IAA5 increased in the tissue (red line) this gene remained unchanged for SPGE data. Interestingly, the magnitude of upregulation for all genes at 11 h after SPGE extraction was in the range of the earlier tissue data points, except for ARG1. Therefore, a drastic difference in values was observed. Similar to the root tip, we considered the average of the hypocotyl tissue (i.e., the average of top and bottom flanks) and found that the transcription levels of all genes were similar ( p  = 0.25) for the hypocotyl and root tip regardless of orientation or time after reorientation. 3. Discussion 3.1. UBQ1 as Reference We verified the usage of UBQ1 as a reference, as UBQ1 expression in both sides of the vertical and top and bottom flanks of the curving hypocotyls did not change significantly ( Figure 2 ). The observed, minor changes in UBQ1 may not be related to curvature but the effect of development and/or differentiation. Hence, UBQ1 was identified as a reference gene [ 62 ] and it was equally expressed in the upper and lower flanks of the gravicurving roots of the Brassica rapa seedlings [ 59 ]. 3.2. Transcription of Auxin Related Genes The transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 varied during the graviresponse of  B. rapa  and is likely mediated by auxin as auxin-induced elongation along the convex side of hypocotyls coincides with the upregulation of these genes, while the concave side shows the reduction in transcription. The connection of these genes with auxin is well established [ 29 , 63 , 64 ], and at least for PIN1 and PIN3, the transcription pattern over time was identical ( Figure 5 ). The initiation and termination of bending [ 65 ] is in line with our observation that the hypocotyl cortex that was probed by SPGE and shows the PIN1 and PIN3 transcription pattern that initially activates the auxin flow to the upper flank, but eventually reverses its lateral polarity to account for the upward orientation of the hypocotyl [ 1 ]. The differential elongation [ 4 ] corresponds with the observed transcription changes and indicates the dependency of basal hypocotyl curvature on auxin mediated processes. The consistent pattern of initial upregulation along the bottom flank and eventual reversal contradicts the notion that hypocotyls curve negatively gravitropic but are in line with earlier observations that young basal hypocotyls of  B. rapa , Linum usitatissimum and other dicots behave similarly to roots and bend positively gravitropic during early growth periods. This behavior reverses as the hypocotyl matures and the orientation of the primary root has been established [ 1 ]. 3.3. Spatio-Temporal Changes during Hypocotyl Curvature The location of tissue and progression of curvature affect gene expression, repressors, and other auxin signaling factors [ 66 ]. The varying transcription of genes in  B. rapa  roots [ 53 ], indicates transcription differences along the curving hypocotyl; their variance over time should coincide with temporal and spatial changes of curvature and related gene expression. All examined genes exhibited changes in their transcription in the upper and lower flank ( Figure 3  and  Figure 5 ,  Figure 6  and  Figure 7 ) of gravicurving hypocotyl over time. The initial upregulation in the lower flank and downregulation along the upper flank is in line with the observed downward curvature in young hypocotyls [ 1 ]. The increased transcription activity along the lower flank is indicative of auxin-induced growth inhibition. As the downregulation of all genes on the upper flank at the beginning of hypocotyl curvature (four hours) is greater than the upregulation on the bottom side, the differential ratio (up/down,  Figure 5  and  Figure 6 ) is high and suggests auxin flow to the lower flank. At the midpoint of hypocotyl curvature at 11 h [ 1 ], the auxin asymmetry reaches its maximum and is likely associated with the tipping point [ 3 ] that leads to the subsequent reversal of curvature at about 35 h for PIN1 and IAA5, and 30 h for PIN3 and ARG1. This sequence coincides with the reversal of hypocotyl downward curvature. The transition in gene transcription implies a shift in either lateral auxin transport or auxin sensitivity, possibly mediated by reactive oxygen species or reductive factors [ 67 ]. The significance of this observation is the ensuing change of curvature from positive to negative gravitropic and that it reaches the typical negative gravitropic curvature that is characteristic of mature hypocotyls. Although the transcription profile 48 h after reorientation was not equal on both flanks, the data suggest that the hypocotyl curvature for the different curvatures rely on the same genes but does not address what causes the reversal of auxin sensitivity over time. However, the effect of auxin levels and ensuing gene transcription will also be affected by the cessation of the ability to elongate; therefore, the maturing tissue no longer responds to changes in auxin-mediated development and the reversal in hypocotyl curvature, i.e., negative gravitropism, depends on tissue that is still expanding. The high-resolution SPGE analysis revealed changes in the transcription profile within the curving tissue ( Figure 6 ). The greatest polarity was associated with the central probes (#2 and #5), therefore SPGE profiling is sensitive to spatial differentiation and expansion. The differences between the central and distal probes illustrate both auxin effect and the spatial dependency of gene activation. Future work will investigate if vertically oriented hypocotyls show maturation-dependent changes in gene transcription. The combination of sensitivity, age, and stimulation (auxin) are likely to control (differential) elongation  Despite the overall similarity in the assessment of transcription activities, there were differences between the individual genes and sampling positions. Notably PIN1 and PIN3 showed its lowest transcription after four hours at the apical-most upper position and increased without reaching a minimum at 11 h. The same trend prevailed for IAA5 and ARG1 ( Figure 6 ). Possibly, the apical region is less sensitive for curvature, and thus, inhibition. Another consideration relates to the expression of PIN3 and ARG1 in the endodermis [ 46 ] and their involvement in shoot gravitropism [ 43 ] via polar auxin transport. Therefore, the signal may not have been maximal as SPGE sampling clearly involved cortical tissue. Nonetheless, the polarity of all examined genes was higher for SPGE than for tissue analyses ( Figure 5  vs.  Figure 6 ), supporting SPGE-based sampling as a valuable tool for the study of physiological processes. IAA5 is considered a gravitropic response indicator as its distribution reflects gravity-induced auxin asymmetry [ 68 ]. IAA5 had the highest transcription levels (lowest Cq values,  Figure 4 ). However, its lateral polarity was less than that of the other examined genes.  3.4. Comparison of Root Tip and Hypocotyl The root tips of horizontally oriented seedlings reach a vertical position after four hours of reorientation [ 1 ]. Therefore, lateral auxin gradients are likely to not exist at longer times. The comparison between root tip tissue and SPGE sampling shows that both sampling methods detect a similar change in transcription, but tissue samples show larger signals during curvature. Since no concave or convex tissues were sampled, the signal likely reflects a general increase in transcription. SPGE shows a similar increase, but after a significant delay. Both sampling profiles showed a comparable order of activation. The notable exception was IAA5, which was substantially higher in the tissue and remained unchanged in SPGE samples. This discrepancy may stem from a higher mRNA quantity in tissue that was not represented in SPGE extracts such as the developing stele or epidermis [ 69 ]. The rapid increase in all transcripts in tissue samples occurred over a longer time in SPGE samples. This increase is not related to curvature but likely illustrates the increase in transcription as the root ages or sensitivities change during vertical orientation. Changes in sensitivity with age have been documented previously [ 1 , 70 , 71 ] and indicate that despite the lack of curvature-specific differences, root tips are a suitable reference for hypocotyl-related changes in gene transcriptio",

The graviresponse is completed after about 20 h. The sampling intervals were chosen to coincide with the onset of hypocotyl curvature (four hours after reorientation), the midpoint of curvature (45-degree curvature of the hypocotyl; 11 h) and vertically oriented seedlings (48 h after the initial reorientation). 2.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction, Yield, and Reference RNA extraction of tissue was performed along the upper and lower flank of the basal hypocotyl from tissue extraction or by Solid Phase Gene Extraction ( Figure 1 ). The average cDNA yield was based on the amount of cDNA after reverse transcription. The tissue extraction (258 ± 16 µg) was significantly higher ( p  < 10 −10 ) than the yield from SPGE probes (0.654 ± 0.024 µg). Nonetheless, reliable qPCR experiments of SPGE samples were possible. Although UBQ1 transcription was not steady ( Figure 2 ), the changes were small in comparison to auxin-sensitive genes and UBQ1 transcription between the upper and lower flank remained similar ( p  = 0.75) throughout the experimental period ( Figure 3 ); therefore, UBQ1 is an acceptable reference gene. 2.3. Transcription in the Hypocotyl Base Tissue The transcription of auxin related genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were similar on the left and right flanks of vertically oriented hypocotyls ( Figure 4 ) but changed after horizontal reorientation. PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were downregulated along the top flank but upregulated in the bottom tissue. PIN1 transcription did not change during the first four hours but after 11 h of reorientation increased in the lower flank and decreased along the upper flank. At that time, all genes showed maximal changes in transcription activities ( Figure 5 ). The transcription analysis by SPGE showed similar profiles as the tissue data. The downregulation of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 along the top coincided with upregulation along the lower flank ( Figure 6 ) four and 11 h after reorientation. After 48 h, when the hypocotyl approaches vertical position, this trend of transcription expression was reversed, i.e., transcription was upregulated in the upper flank and downregulated in the lower flanks. SPGE sampling showed the largest difference in transcription at the point of the maximum curvature (probe #2 and #5,  Figure 1 ) compared to the adjacent positions after four and 11 h. The ratio of the fold change over time of all genes at position five vs. two varied by gene and showed the smallest signal after 48 h ( Figure 6 ). Considering the transcription for probe two and five (the points of maximal curvature on the convex and concave flank, respectively, for different time points showed that after four hours, the ratio for PIN1 and ARG1 was similar. IAA5 transcription was twice as high at the bottom (#5) than top (#2) position. At 11 h, PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 showed similar values for the convex and concave sites. The polarity of IAA5 was less, but still reached about five times the value of the top flank. After 48 h, the values were reversed and the polarity for PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 between the top and bottom side was about six to eight-fold; the polarity for IAA5 was weaker. These data show that after reversal of the curvature the transcription of the examined genes reached a comparable but reversed polarity as after 11 h. 2.4.

  "discussion": "3. Discussion 3.1. UBQ1 as Reference We verified the usage of UBQ1 as a reference, as UBQ1 expression in both sides of the vertical and top and bottom flanks of the curving hypocotyls did not change significantly ( Figure 2 ). The observed, minor changes in UBQ1 may not be related to curvature but the effect of development and/or differentiation. Hence, UBQ1 was identified as a reference gene [ 62 ] and it was equally expressed in the upper and lower flanks of the gravicurving roots of the Brassica rapa seedlings [ 59 ]. 3.2. Transcription of Auxin Related Genes The transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 varied during the graviresponse of  B. rapa  and is likely mediated by auxin as auxin-induced elongation along the convex side of hypocotyls coincides with the upregulation of these genes, while the concave side shows the reduction in transcription. The connection of these genes with auxin is well established [ 29 , 63 , 64 ], and at least for PIN1 and PIN3, the transcription pattern over time was identical ( Figure 5 ). The initiation and termination of bending [ 65 ] is in line with our observation that the hypocotyl cortex that was probed by SPGE and shows the PIN1 and PIN3 transcription pattern that initially activates the auxin flow to the upper flank, but eventually reverses its lateral polarity to account for the upward orientation of the hypocotyl [ 1 ]. The differential elongation [ 4 ] corresponds with the observed transcription changes and indicates the dependency of basal hypocotyl curvature on auxin mediated processes. The consistent pattern of initial upregulation along the bottom flank and eventual reversal contradicts the notion that hypocotyls curve negatively gravitropic but are in line with earlier observations that young basal hypocotyls of  B. rapa , Linum usitatissimum and other dicots behave similarly to roots and bend positively gravitropic during early growth periods. This behavior reverses as the hypocotyl matures and the orientation of the primary root has been established [ 1 ]. 3.3. Spatio-Temporal Changes during Hypocotyl Curvature The location of tissue and progression of curvature affect gene expression, repressors, and other auxin signaling factors [ 66 ]. The varying transcription of genes in  B. rapa  roots [ 53 ], indicates transcription differences along the curving hypocotyl; their variance over time should coincide with temporal and spatial changes of curvature and related gene expression. All examined genes exhibited changes in their transcription in the upper and lower flank ( Figure 3  and  Figure 5 ,  Figure 6  and  Figure 7 ) of gravicurving hypocotyl over time. The initial upregulation in the lower flank and downregulation along the upper flank is in line with the observed downward curvature in young hypocotyls [ 1 ]. The increased transcription activity along the lower flank is indicative of auxin-induced growth inhibition. As the downregulation of all genes on the upper flank at the beginning of ",
  "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the basal hypocotyl curvature depends on auxin mediated process and involves the same genes for downward or upward curvature that were found to be involved in root curvature. The expression trend for auxin related genes in positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature reverses when the hypocotyls begin to develop negative gravitropism. High resolution sampling revealed spatial variation in the transcription of auxin related genes throughout the curvature with the greatest polarity present at the most concave and convex position in the curvature."
