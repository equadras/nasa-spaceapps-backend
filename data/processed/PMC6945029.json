  "abstract": "Leptopilina heterotoma  are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their  Drosophila  hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of  L. heterotoma  MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of  L. heterotoma  MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the  L. heterotoma  MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and  de novo  assembly of the 460 Mb-sized  L. heterotoma  genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.",

  "full_text": "Parasitic wasps are among the most abundant insects; they are vital to biodiversity and contribute to biological control of agricultural pests ( Narendran 2001 ;  Rodriguez  et al.  2013 ). A common strategy for reproductive success of parasitic wasps is suppression of immunity in their larval hosts. Parasitic wasps produce viruses or virus-like particles in tissues associated with the ovary. Wasps of the Ichneumonoidea superfamily produce symbiotic polydnaviruses (PDVs), which package circular dsDNA. PDV (Bracovirus (BV) in braconid wasps; Ichnovirus (IV) in ichneumonid wasps) genomes are integrated within the wasp genome as islands of viral genes. Upon oviposition, PDVs suppress host immunity. BVs and IVs derive from nudivirus and large DNA cytoplasmic viruses, respectively (reviewed in  Strand and Burke 2015 ;  Drezen  et al.  2017 ;  Gauthier  et al.  2018 , and references therein). Immune-suppressive virus-like particles (VLPs) ( e.g. , VcVLPs in the ichneumonid  Venturia canescens  and FaENVs in the braconid  Fopius arisanus ) lack proviral DNA segments, but are of viral origin and transfer virulence proteins into host cells ( Pichon  et al.  2015 ;  Burke  et al.  2018 ). Viral genes encoding VLP proteins are either dispersed in the wasp genome (as in VcVLP) or present in discrete genomic areas (as in FaENV). Thus, various independent viral endogenization events have been important for successful parasitism by these wasps ( Strand and Burke 2015 ;  Gauthier  et al.  2018 ). Here, we focus on immune-suppressive particles of figitid wasps in the genus  Leptopilina , that infect  Drosophila  spp. and are gaining importance as models for natural host-parasite interactions ( Keebaugh and Schlenke 2014 ).  Leptopilina heterotoma  ( Lh ),  L. victoriae  ( Lv ), and  L. boulardi  ( Lb ) produce VLPs in their venom glands. The VLPs of  Leptopilina  spp. and their proteins have been linked to parasite success ( Rizki  et al.  1990 ;  Dupas  et al.  1996 ;  Morales  et al.  2005 ;  Labrosse  et al.  2005 ;  Chiu  et al.  2006 ;  Heavner  et al.  2014 ). Evidence for DNA in  Leptopilina  VLPs is lacking, and because of the absence of a published wasp genome, the chromosomal  vs.  extrachromosomal location of MSEV protein genes is not known. Our goals here are (a) to describe additional proteins in the MSEV proteome and examine their relationship with PDV and other viral proteins, and (b) determine whether MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome. We recently described 161 proteins in the VLPs from two  Lh  strains in three classes: conserved eukaryotic with cellular function (Class 1), infection- and immunity-related (Class 2), and unannotated (novel) without similarity to known proteins (Class 3) ( Heavner  et al.  2017 ). Class 1 proteins include several vesicular transport and endomembrane system proteins. Class 2 proteins include predicted modulators of immune response,  e.g. , metalloendopeptidases, RhoGAPs, a knottin-like protein, and a new family of prokaryotic-like GTPases whose genes lack introns. A striking example of Class 3 proteins is p40, with three-dimensional structural similarity to Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) needle-tip proteins, IpaD/SipD/BipD from Gram-negative bacteria,  Salmonella ,  Shigella  and  Burkholderia . Earlier results have indicated that the  p40  gene (unlike the  GTPase  genes) is expected to have introns. These results suggested that  Lh  VLPs have novel properties with elements of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic secretion systems and possess a functionally diverse array of immune-suppressive proteins. We therefore renamed VLPs as Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs). Their variable morphologies distinguish them from ordered PDV morphologies. Additionally, genes encoding abundant MSEV proteins p40 and GTPase are present even in antibiotic-treated wasps. These results favored a non-microbial nature for MSEVs ( Heavner  et al.  2017 ). Here, we present an analysis of an additional 246 proteins from the  Lh  14 MSEV proteome to obtain a more comprehensive description. A combined analysis of these and previous results reinforce the idea that the MSEV proteome is enriched in exosomal proteins and that Class 3 proteins are not shared with either  Lb  or an unrelated  Ganaspis  spp. Whole-body transcriptome of adult  Lh  wasps validated the expression of the MSEV genes.  De novo  genomic assembly and analyses revealed 90% of conserved Insecta Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs), as well as a majority (375/407; ∼90%) of the MSEV proteins are encoded in the wasp genome. While we cannot rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, in aggregate, our results provide a clearer understanding of the current nature of these complex structures and strengthen the idea that specialized extracellular vesicles transfer wasp virulence factors and other parasite proteins into  Drosophila  host cells. Materials and Methods Insects Isogenized  Lh  strains New York (NY; ( Chiu and Govind 2002 ;  Chiu  et al.  2006 )) and  Lh  14 ( Schlenke  et al.  2007 ), were raised on the  y w  strain of  D. melanogaster  that were reared on standard cornmeal, yeast, and agar fly food at 25° as described by  Small  et al . (2012) . Adult wasps were collected from parasitized hosts, 25 days after infection at 25°. Male and female wasps were stored on fly food with 70% honey on “buzz” plugs. Analysis of MSEV super-set ORFs Previously undescribed open reading frames (ORFs) from the  Lh  14 MSEV proteome and sequenced as part of  Heavner  et al . (2017)  (PXD005632) are analyzed in the context of the published female abdominal ( Goecks  et al.  2013 ) and whole body (this study)  Lh  14 transcriptomes. We have not observed any difference in venom activities of  Lh  14 and  Lh  NY ( Morales  et al.  2005 ;  Schlenke  et al.  2007 ), or in wasp success under laboratory conditions. The  Lh  14 ORFs were aligned against transcripts from BioProject: PRJNA202370, Accession number GAJC0000000 ( Goecks  et al.  2013 ) as previously described in  Heavner  et al . (2017) . Proteins with an ORF and a transcript were run through the BLAST2GO (v 5.2; downloaded June 2018) annotation pipeline with an E-value threshold of 1x10 −7  ( Conesa  et al.  2005 ;  Götz  et al.  2008 ). Results were organized and classified based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms from UniProt and InterPro ( Ashburner  et al.  2000 ;  Jones  et al.  2014 ;  Uniport Consortium 2015 ;  The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019 ). Proteins were considered “virulence-related” based on GO terms indicating involvement with infection, host evasion, inflammation, and immune response. ORFs that did not return results via BLAST or InterProScan (Class 3 proteins) were run through Conserved Domain Search (CDD) on NCBI (version 3.16) ( Marchler-Bauer  et al.  2017 ). The E-value cut off for CDD search was 1x10 −2 . Proteins were considered to have a signal peptide if one was predicted using Phobeus and Signal P ( Käll  et al.  2004 ;  Käll  et al.  2007 ;  Nielsen 2017 ;  Almagro Armenteros  et al.  2019 ). Transmembrane domains were considered to be present if they were predicted using Phobeus and TMHMM ( Sonnhammer  et al.  1998 ;  Krogh  et al.  2001 ;  Käll  et al.  2004 ;  Käll  et al.  2007 ). The GhostKOALA algorithm ( Kanehisa  et al.  2016 ) was used to assign KEGG ortholog (KO) numbers for the MSEV superset protein sequences. If a primary KO number failed to be assigned by GhostKOALA, a secondary number assignment with a score >= 50 was used. Redundant KO numbers were excluded. MSEV proteins were included in the enrichment analyses only if a human ortholog exists; the gene identifiers for human orthologs were obtained from the MSEV KO and the UniProt mapping utility ( Li  et al.  2015 ;  Uniport Consortium 2015 ). (Human orthologs were chosen because a robust proportion of Vesiclepedia’s data are derived from human vesicle proteomes.) The orthologs of human genes were analyzed for enrichment with the FunRich algorithm ( Pathan  et al.  2015 ;  Pathan  et al.  2017 ) against the Vesiclepedia database ( Kalra  et al.  2012 ;  Pathan  et al.  2019 ). Finally, the MSEV proteome was used as a query using BLASTp for the following databases: “non-redundant” (nr), nr restricted to Taxid: Viridae (10239), nr restricted to Taxid: Polydnaviridae (10482), and nr restricted to Taxid: Unclassified Polydnaviridae (40273) (E-value threshold: 1.0x10 −3 , %ID minimum: 20%, performed 04/16/2019). tBLASTn of  L. boulardi  and  G. hookeri  (previously called  Ganaspis spp. 1 ) ( Goecks  et al.  2013 ) transcriptomes was performed on 03/10/2019; the threshold for homologs in  Lb  and  G. hookeri  were 25% ID and an E-value of 1.0x10 −10 . Genomes sequencing and assembly Library preparations, sequencing reactions, and associated validations were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Genomic DNA was extracted from ∼50 mg of tissue (∼100 wasps) of  Lh  males and females separately using mixed bead beating and PureLink Genomic DNA extraction kits following manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of extracted DNA was performed using Nanodrop and Qubit2.0 Fluorometer (Live Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Integrity of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis (0.6% agarose). DNA libraries were prepared for each wasp gender by acoustic shearing fragmentation using a Covaris S220. Fragments were end repaired and adenylated prior to adapter ligation on 3′ ends (NEB NextUltra DNA Library Preparation kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Enrichment and indexing of adapter-ligated DNA was done through limited cycle PCR. DNA library validation was performed using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Libraries were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Real time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify DNA molar mass for each library before multiplexing in equal molar mass. DNA libraries were sequenced using a 2x150 paired-end (PE) configuration on one lane on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) on the HiSeq instrument. The average size of inserts (without adaptors) in the Illumina library was ∼300-350 bp.  De novo  assembly of reads and scaffolding of contigs was performed using ABySS 2.2 ( Jackman  et al.  2017 ) by the New York Genome Center.  De novo  assembly of combined male/female genome was performed using Platanus-allee ( Kajitani  et al.  2019 ) and scaffolding was improved using AGOUTI ( Zhang  et al.  2016 ) on the University of Delaware’s BIOMIX cluster. Sequences from  Drosophila -associated bacteria such as  Wolbachia  spp.,  Acetobacter pasteurianus , and  Lactobacillus plantarum  were identified in both assemblies.  Wolbachia  are endosymbionts of many insects including  Leptopilina  spp. ( Pannebakker  et al.  2004 ;  Werren  et al.  2008 ;  Gueguen  et al.  2012 ).  Lactobacilli  and  Acetobacter  are symbionts and commensals of sugar-consuming insects ( Crotti  et al.  2010 ;  Engel and Moran 2013 ). Among the three bacterial species,  Wolbachia  sequences were the most abundant. BLASTx analysis showed that predicted genes from  Wolbachia  scaffolds were associated with  Wolbachia  proteins in GenBank. These bacterial and mitochondrial sequence-containing scaffolds were identified during the NCBI submission process and were manually removed from the submission. Evaluation of genome assemblies Assemblies made with ABySS and Platanus-allee with AGOUTI were run through QUAST v4.0 ( Mikheenko  et al.  2016 ) to determine scaffold number, N50, and GC%. All assemblies were examined for conserved genes and orthologs with BUSCO v9 ( Simão  et al.  2015 ;  Waterhouse  et al.  2017 ) using the Insecta set and training parameters set to “Nasonia”. NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used to compare selected scaffolds produced from male and female genome assemblies ( Johnson  et al.  2008 ;  Camacho  et al.  2009 ). E-value threshold was set at 1x10 −7 . E-values of alignments were considered acceptable if within the range of 0 to 1x10 −10 . K-mer analysis was performed using the K-mer Analysis Toolkit (KAT) ( Mapleson  et al.  2016 ) and heat maps were used to compare multiplicity (coverage plus repeats) of K-mers to GC content of the reads, coloring bins according to the number of distinct K-mers in each. This analysis was used to determine whether there were separate clusters of multiplicity/GC content that might arise from different sources, such as contamination. BLAST ( Altschul  et al.  1990 ;  Camacho  et al.  2009 ;  Johnson  et al.  2008 ) was used to search for homologs of a random sample of genomic scaffolds to which reads from each cluster mapped. The joint assembly of the  Lh 14  genome was compared to the published  L. clavipes  genome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205 ( Kraaijeveld  et al.  2016 )) through maps of 27-mer multiplicity  vs.  GC content. Finally, 27-mer multiplicity/GC content of the scaffolds (9.6 Mb) containing MSEV genes was compared to a random subset of scaffolds (9.6 Mb) without MSEV genes. Statistical differences between  Lh 14  and  L. clavipes  genomes and between MSEV-gene containing scaffolds and non-MSEV-gene containing scaffolds were calculated using a multivariate Cramér test ( Ihaka and Gentleman 1996 ;  Baringhaus and Franz 2004 ;  Franz 2019 ). Gene predictions, gene annotation, and viral gene searches Gene predictions were performed on parallel and anti-parallel strands using AUGUSTUS (v3.3.1; August 2018) ( Stanke  et al.  2004 ;  Stanke and Morgenstern 2005 ;  Keller  et al.  2011 ) with the  Nasonia  training set. The AUGUSTUS readout was separated into mRNA, coding DNA sequence (CDS), and translations by gffread ( Trapnell  et al.  2012 ). Gene predictions were annotated by performing a BLASTx of all gene predictions against the entire nr database (Downloaded on January 2019) and InterProScan on the University of Delaware BIOMIX Cluster before using BLAST2GO ( Conesa  et al.  2005 ;  Götz  et al.  2008 ) to finish annotation based on BLASTx and InterProScan results. NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used on a local machine to search predictions and scaffolds, cutoff was %ID >70%, E-value < 1E-50, and query coverage > 70%. MSEV genes and 1x10 −2  for Polydnavirus and Nudivirus proteins. Family  Polydnaviridae  and  Nudiviridae  protein sequences for the 11 species available on OrthoDB v9 were downloaded on February 2019 ( Johnson  et al.  2008 ;  Camacho  et al.  2009 ). Whole-body transcriptome sequencing and assembly Total RNA extraction, library preparations, sequencing reactions, and bioinformatics analysis were conducted at GENEWIZ, INC (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). RNA was extracted from frozen tissue with the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Universal mini kit using manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted RNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and its integrity was checked with the 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). RNA samples were enriched for mRNA using Oligo d(T) beads. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The sequencing libraries were validated by using the Agilent TapeStation. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilimington, MA, USA). Sequencing libraries were clustered on a single lane of a flow cell and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument using a 2x150 PE configuration. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HCS. Raw sequence data (.bcl files) was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina’s bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mismatch was allowed for index sequence identification. The Trinity v2.5 ( Grabherr  et al.  2011 ),  de novo  assembler was used to assemble the  Lh 14  transcripts. The  de novo  assembled transcriptome was created with a minimum contig length of 200 bp per sample. Transrate v1.0.3 ( Smith-Unna  et al.  2016 ) was used to generate statistics for the  de novo  assembled transcriptome. EMBOSS tools getorf were then used to find the ORFs within the  de novo  assembled transcriptome. The  de novo  transcriptome assembly was then annotated using Diamond BLASTx ( Buchfink  et al.  2015 ). The transcriptome reads were mapped to the genomic scaffolds for downstream analyses using HISAT2 or BWA ( Li and Durbin 2009 ;  Kim  et al.  2015 ). Preparation of template DNA and PCR Male and female wasps (n = 12, for each sex), were separated and washed in 70% ethanol, and then rinsed twice in deionized water. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit following provided protocols. gDNA was eluted in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, and stored at 4°. The concentration of gDNA was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). For cDNA preparation, male and female wasps (n = 12 for each sex), were separated and washed in 70% ethanol and rinsed twice in deionized water. Total body RNA was extracted using 100 µL of Trizol (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocols. RNA was resuspended in 0.1% DEPC treated water and treated with DNase I to remove contaminating DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was synthesized using Proto-Script First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Analysis of select genes Primers for  p40 and SmGTPase01  are as follows: p40  forward: GAATCATTGTTCGTTTGCTTGAAGAAAGAATTGG p40  reverse: CATTATTAATGGGCCTTTACAATAATTTTAGCC SmGTPase01  forward: CGTTGCACTACCTTGTTTGTCA SmGTPase01  reverse: TTGTCTTTGCCCTGAGCGTT PCRs were performed with Taq polymerase (gift of C. Li lab, CCNY), PCR buffer (300 mM Tris HCl pH 9.5, 75 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 10 mM MgCl 2 ) and deoxyribonucleotides (0.2 mM; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel in Tris acetic acid EDTA buffer (40 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 20 mM acetic acid, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0). Ethidium bromide (Sigma Aldrich)-stained gels were visualized on an ultra violet Trans-Illuminator (UVP) and gel images were taken using the DigiDocIt Imaging System (UVP). Gel images were processed in Adobe Photoshop for clarity only. gDNA or cDNA-containing PCR products were cloned into pCR TOPO II plasmids (Invitrogen) and transformed into DH10β competent cells (New England Biolabs). For plasmid preparation, colonies were screened via PCR and positive colonies were cultured in Luria Broth with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) at 37° overnight. Plasmids were extracted using Plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced (GENEWIZ, INC. South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Sequences were aligned using NCBI BLAST+ ( Johnson  et al.  2008 ;  Camacho  et al.  2009 ) and Clustal Omega ( Li  et al.  2015 ). Expected PCR band sizes were determined using SerialCloner (v2.6.1). Data availability L. heterotoma  strains ( Chiu  et al.  2006 ;  Schlenke  et al.  2007 ) are available upon request.

  "results": "Results and Discussion The MSEV proteome superset A comparative study of the proteomes of the MSEVs from  Lh  14 and  Lh  NY strains previously generated a list of 161 “common” MSEV proteins ( Heavner  et al.  2017 ). More than 90% of the 161 proteins are part of the  Lh  14 MSEV proteome. To describe MSEVs more completely, we characterized a larger set of 407 MSEV proteins from  Lh  14 (161 common and 246  Lh  14) and define this set as the  Lh  MSEV “super-set” ( Figure 1A ). Key results from annotation-based classification, analysis for signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain, and presence/absence of proteins in related wasps are summarized below and in Table S1. Figure 1 The superset of MSEV proteins: (A)  Lh  14 MSEV proteins were annotated using BLAST2GO prior to class sorting via annotation and GO Terms. Wedges denoted as “Common,” were previously published in ( Heavner  et al.  2017 ) and represent proteins found in both  Lh  14 and  Lh  NY MSEV proteomes. New proteins analyzed in this work are in wedges labeled “ Lh  14 Only.” A majority of proteins belong to Class 1. Table S1 lists 246 proteins added to the superset  Lh  14 proteome. (B) and (C) Enrichment analysis of MSEV superset shows high association with exosomes and mitochondria compared to other cellular organelles according to Vesiclepedia. –log  10  (p-value) trend shown in orange for both graphs. The p-values were calculated with the Bonferroni method. (B) Percentage of MSEV genes associated with specific cellular compartments found in Vesiclepedia, relative to all MSEV genes. Of the superset proteins, 41 and 49% are associated with mitochondria and exosomes, respectively ( P  = 3 × 10 −57 ; 1 × 10 −53 ). (C) Fold-enrichment of the MSEV dataset in specific cellular compartments. Although many protein classes are present in the proteome, exosomal and mitochondrial proteins show more significant enrichments. The presence/absence of signal peptide (SP) alone, or SP with/without the transmembrane (TM) domain(s) in MSEV proteins reveals their possible location ( i.e. , potentially secreted into the venom gland lumen or associated with MSEV membrane). We therefore searched the 246  Lh  14 proteins for SP and TM domains. Of the 246 proteins, 55 (22.35%) have a predicted SP domain, 37 (15.04%) have a predicted TM domain, while 6 (2.44%) have both a predicted SP and TM domain. After annotation, we found that a majority (183/246 or 75%) of the 246 proteins can be classified as core eukaryotic cell biology proteins (Class 1); 13/246 (5%) proteins as virulence- and immunity-related based on associated GO terms ( Ashburner  et al.  2000 ;  The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019 ) (Class 2); and 50/246 or 20% as novel sequences without high confidence annotation (Class 3) (Table S1). A presence/absence analysis of these 246 proteins in published transcriptomes ( Goecks  et al.  2013 ) of  Lb  or a more distantly related wasp,  G. hookeri  (for thresholds see Methods) revealed the following: only 43/246 (17%)  Lh  MSEV proteins are expected to be found in  Lb  and/or  G. hookeri  (Table S1). Of these, 33/43 (77%) proteins were in Class 1 but only 7/43 (16%) and 3/43 (7%) were in Class 2 and Class 3 categories, respectively. These results support the idea that, multiple but different, infection strategies and/or host evasion strategies might exist among different wasps infecting the same hosts. While most of the Class 1 proteins were annotated as ribosomal or mitochondrial-related, a few were described as integral membrane proteins, vesicle trafficking protein SEC22b (E-value: 6.22E-145), and the ion channels sideroflexin 1 and 2 (E-value: 0). We also identified an apolipophorin (E-value: 1.02E-7) (Table S1). The presence of these membrane-associated proteins reinforces the vesicular nature of MSEVs. Examples of Class 2 proteins include the neural/ectodermal development factor IMP-L2 (E-value: 5.29x10 −50 ) and a protein involved in pain reception, CG9231 (E-value: 4.39x10 −",
