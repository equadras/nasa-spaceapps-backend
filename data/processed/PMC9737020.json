For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for  n uclear  a ssembly  p rotein  1 \n l ike  1  (NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34 + -derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis.",

  "full_text": "1. Introduction Megakaryocytes (MKs) are highly specialized precursor cells, residing in the bone marrow [ 1 ] and lungs [ 2 ], that produce and finally release platelets (PLTs) [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. The development and maturation of MKs and the subsequent production of PLTs by MKs are tightly regulated and depend on external cues [ 6 , 7 , 8 ]. During the final stages of MK development, the cytoplasm is massively reorganized and long cytoplasmic extensions are formed, coined proplatelets [ 9 ]. Two cytoskeletal systems provide the force leading to the shape changes associated with MK maturation and proplatelet formation: actin filaments and microtubules assembled from tubulin subunits [ 10 , 11 ]. More specifically, it was demonstrated that dynein-dependent microtubule sliding acts as the driving force for proplatelet elongation and PLT biogenesis [ 11 ]. In this context, it is important to note that such processes are strictly dependent on sufficient availability of ATP as an energy source [ 12 ]. Once released into the circulation, PLTs impose as small, and anucleate cells. In the past, PLTs have traditionally been considered simple ‘sacs of glue’ with limited functionality beyond acute hemostasis due to the lack of a cell nucleus. However, in recent years, PLTs have been identified as dynamic effector cells bridging the inflammatory, immune, and hemostatic continuum [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ]. One mechanism explaining the multitude of functional responses is that MKs are equipped to sense external stimuli that trigger differential expression and packaging of mRNA and proteins into their progeny, causing distinct PLT functional alterations, especially in disease [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ]. Hence, although PLTs are anucleate, we found that the PLTs’ array of mRNAs is dynamic and can undergo active re-programming [ 8 , 17 , 18 , 19 ]. Furthermore, intricate processes regulate RNA processing, expression, and translational events [ 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] in PLTs. In concert with maintaining nuclear RNA processing capabilities, numerous studies have shown that PLTs possess nuclear proteins, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-c, and retinoid X receptor (RXR) [ 29 , 30 ], and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) [ 28 , 31 ]. Sepsis is a common, and often morbid, syndrome which is characterized by systemic inflammation and dysregulated host immune responses triggered by invading pathogens or toxins (i.e., Toll-like receptor [TLR] agonists like LPS), frequently intensified by injurious agonists generated by the infected organism. The MK-PLT axis plays a major role in orchestrating sepsis-related thromboinflammatory and immunothrombotic events [ 7 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 ]. MKs were demonstrated to synergistically react to TLR 2/4 agonists in combination with thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling by increasing their proliferation, and thrombopoiesis [ 36 ]. However, this effect could only be observed in immature CD34+ cells, while MKs in the past 7 days of culture demonstrated slightly decreasing numbers when treated with LPS. Finally, PLT aggregation and the formation of heterotypic PLT-leukocyte aggregates in septic patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [ 37 , 38 , 39 ]. Nevertheless, the direct impact of PLTs in the pathobiology of sepsis remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, several cell biology aspects, and mechanistic insight into PLT and MK functions during septic events are still obscure. The purification and functional characterization of a 53 kDa protein facilitating nucleosome assembly in mammalian cells was first described in 1984 [ 40 ]. The NAP-family, including nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1), is a group of proteins with chaperone function, capable of binding histones and coordinating their assemblance into nucleosomal particles [ 41 ]. Several additional binding partners for NAP-family members were identified, including transcription factors, proteins regulating nuclear import (karyopherins), and factors involved in cell cycle regulation (reviewed in [ 41 ]). Specifically, NAP1L1 was described to promote proliferation of pluripotent stem cells [ 42 ] through cell cycle interference. Furthermore, NAP1L1, in concert with NAP1L4, can act as a histone chaperone [ 43 ], and serving as a co-factor for ubiquitination client selection [ 44 ]. Furthermore, numerous studies describe NAP1L1 as a prognostic marker in select cancer entities (i.e., colon cancer [ 45 ], hepatocellular carcinoma [ 46 ], ovarian cancer [ 47 ], and lung cancer [ 48 ]), and its involvement in a number of signaling pathways, which were demonstrated to result in tumor progression. NAP1L1 mRNA expression in human PLTs was previously described [ 49 ]; however, no function was assigned to this versatile nuclear protein in such anucleate cells, or its progenitors, MKs. Here, we demonstrate that MKs and human PLTs endogenously express differential NAP1L1 mRNA variants and protein isoforms. We identified PDC-E2, a subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH complex), as a protein interaction partner. In PLTs, septic conditions induced increased expression of NAP1L1 protein, and PDH complex activity. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of NAP1L1 in MKs resulted in reduced proplatelet formation, and decreased PDH complex activity when treated with LPS, simulating a septic environment. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified NAP1L1 interaction partner in human PLTs and MKs. Furthermore, this newly described protein–protein interaction seems to influence PDH complex activity, with subsequent functional disturbances of these specialized cells. 2. Results 2.1. CD34 + -Derived MKs and Freshly Isolated Human PLTs Express NAP1L1 We initially sought to determine RNA expression patterns of  NAP1L1  in CD34 +  hematopoietic progenitor cell-derived MKs and freshly isolated human PLTs. Next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that MKs and human PLTs express messenger RNA (mRNA) for  NAP1L1  ( Figure 1 A,B). Consistent with its expression demonstrated via RNA-seq,  NAP1L1  mRNA was also detected in MKs using PCR techniques ( Figure 1 C).  NAP1L1  was consistently expressed over the entire time course of MK culture and differentiation. Furthermore,  NAP1L1  was readily detectable in RNA samples isolated from human PLTs ( Figure 1 D). Of note, all PLT samples used for these studies were DNase treated to exclude any DNA contaminants from nucleated cells. Since multiple alternative transcripts are described to exist for  NAP1L1 , we next performed PCR experiments using a primer pair spanning from exon 1 to exon 7, enabling us to detect a potential alternative  NAP1L1  transcript variant 5, which is devoid of exons 3 and 4 ( Figure 2 A). MKs as well as PLT samples demonstrated the presence of PCR products indicative of  NAP1L1  transcript variant 1 ( Figure 2 B,C), PCR product band indicated at ~600 bp) and transcript variant 5 ( Figure 2 B,C, PCR product band indicated at ~400 bp). These findings were verified by Sanger sequencing for excised PCR products, demonstrating full length transcript as well as a transcript devoid of exon 3 and 4 (data not shown). In addition, we were able to detect  NAP1L1  transcript variants at all stages of MK differentiation ( Figure 2 B). Furthermore, allowing the incubation of PLTs overnight ( Figure 2 C), or the placement of PLTs on immobilized fibrinogen and stimulating the cells using thrombin ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) did not alter the expression pattern of alternative transcripts; therefore, no loading control was included. Consistent with our findings by PCR and Sanger sequencing ( Figure 1  and  Figure 2 , and data not shown), we found that NAP1L1 protein is endogenously and robustly expressed in situ in the cytoplasm and proplatelet extensions of MKs ( Figure 3 A). It is interesting to note that NAP1L1 protein localization in MKs is less pronounced in cell nuclei; however, it demonstrates some peri-nuclear enhancement. Furthermore, cells undergoing anaphase showed reduced NAP1L1 association with condensed chromosomes ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). While nucleosome assembly proteins were initially identified as being histone chaperones and chromatin-assembly factors, additional functions were assigned including tissue-specific transcription regulation, apoptosis, histone shuttling, cell-cycle regulation, and additional chaperone functions beyond histone binding [ 41 ]. Our microscopic findings in MKs could potentially point towards such extra nuclear functions. In unstimulated human PLTs, NAP1L1 protein concentrated and accumulated peri-granular (when compared with WGA co-staining) in a fine vesicular pattern ( Figure 3 B). Immunoblotting also confirmed our microscopic findings of NAP1L1 protein being present in MKs ( Figure 3 C). Surprisingly, Western blotting revealed three major protein bands at 60, 53 and 37 kDa, while the predicted size for NAP1L1 protein (expected isoform 1) is 43–53 kDa. Therefore, we sought to examine the specificity of the used anti-NAP1L1 antibody. A peptide competition assay (quench experiment) using the immunogenic peptide ( Figure 3 D, right) showed that all three detected protein bands specifically represent NAP1L1 isoforms or potentially post-translational modified NAP1L1 in human PLT samples ( Figure 3 D, left). 2.2. NAP1L1 Directly Interacts with the Dihydrolipopolylysine-Residue Acetyltransferase Component of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC-E2, ODP2) Because of its multitude of functions described in the literature, and its widely unknown roles in MK and PLT cell biology, we next wanted to identify NAP1L1 protein binding partners in human PLTs. To identify such interaction partners, we used carefully controlled co-IP experiments followed by mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses of a selected band. We identified a highly specific protein, which was only present in the specific anti-NAP1L1 pull-down ( Figure 4 A, second lane from left); however, was absent in the isotype-specific IgG control ( Figure 4 A, third lane from left). Furthermore, we excluded non-specific binding to the protein G magnetic beads by including a control condition using those beads only ( Figure 4 A, right lane). Besides contaminating human cytokeratin, which was most likely introduced during protein processing, we found the highest total spectrum count being present for ODP2_HUMAN ( Figure 4 B), the human mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase component (PDC-E2). The highly specific nature of this identified NAP1L1 binding partner was further underscored by its significantly increased normalized spectrum count for peptide sequences, when compared to samples co-IPed using IgG ( Figure 4 C). Consistent with its expression pattern at the peptide level, immunoblotting demonstrated robust and specifically detectable NAP1L1—PDC-E2 protein interaction in human PLTs ( Figure 4 D) using Western blot approaches. PDC-E2—human mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase is the E2 component of the multi-enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). In nucleated cells, DLAT, the gene encoding PDC-E2, is part of the nuclear DNA, and upon translation, the protein needs to be transported to the inner mitochondria membrane. Here, the enzyme transfers acetyl groups to coenzyme A. In addition, PDC can also be present in the nucleus catalyzing histone acetylation [ 50 , 51 ]. In turn, PDC-E2 is also the key antigen in primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic liver disease with autoimmune component targeting intrahepatic bile duct lining cells [ 52 , 53 ]. 2.3. NAP1L1 and PDC-E2 Show Dynamic Expression Changes When PLTs Are Exposed to Septic Conditions NAP1L1 was previously assigned chaperone and transport functions, involving histone complexes [ 54 , 55 ], diacylglycerol kinase ζ [ 56 ], mtHsp70 [ 57 ]. Here, we add an additional interaction partner, PDC-E2, to the evolving functional repertoire of NAP1L1. With PDC-E2 being an integral part of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, we started exploring functional consequences of the NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction. Several studies demonstrated that the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex gets dysregulated due to septic host environment [ 58 , 59 ]. Although anucleate, emerging data demonstrates that the human PLT transcriptome is not static. Rather, the PLT transcriptome is dynamic and markedly altered during systemic inflammatory diseases [ 6 , 7 , 22 , 26 ]. Therefore, we sought to examine NAP1L1 and PDC-E2 protein expression levels in human PLTs isolated from septic patients. To determine whether transcripts coding for NAP1L1 were altered in PLTs during sepsis, we used RNA-seq on highly purified PLTs from septic patients and matched healthy donors. This study was performed as a sub-analysis of a dataset previously published by our group [ 8 ].  Figure 5 A demonstrates the significant increase in mRNA coding for  NAP1L1  in PLTs isolated from septic patients. Having detected significantly increased  NAP1L1  transcript levels in PLTs from septic patients, we hypothesized that NAP1L1 protein expression would similarly be altered during sepsis. We initially used immunofluorescence staining (ICC) to examine NAP1L1 protein expression and localization in PLTs from septic patients and matched healthy control donors. NAP1L1 staining was localized peri-granular (when compared with WGA co-staining) in a fine vesicular pattern ( Figure 5 B). In septic PLTs, using automated image analysis, we detected an increased mean fluorescent intensity for NAP1L1 ( Figure 5 C), which translated into a significant fold-increase of staining intensity (data not shown). To further test the above hypothesis, we used Western blot analysis to examine total PLT NAP1L1 protein expression.  Figure 5 D,E demonstrate significantly increased NAP1L1 protein expression in PLTs from septic patients. In contrast to the increased NAP1L1 expression, Western blot analysis for PDC-E2 showed significantly decreased total protein expression in PLTs isolated from septic patients when compared to healthy controls ( Figure 6 A,B). 2.4. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Activity Is Increased in PLTs during Sepsis The immunometabolism during sepsis is characterized by a switch from a high-energy infection resistance mode to a low-energy conservation tolerance mode within 4–8 h after sepsis dissemination [ 58 ]. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex acts as an energy homeostat, and its deactivation creates an energy supply chain shortage during sepsis. Here, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex activity was significantly increased in PLTs isolated from septic patients when compared to healthy donor PLTs ( Figure 6 C), which could indicate an early stage in the septic continuum. 2.5. NAP1L1 Overexpression in MKs Induced Reduced Proplatelet Formation (PPF) To further establish potential functional consequences of the newly described NAP1L1–PDC-E2 protein interaction, we utilized an established CD34 + -derived human MK cell culture model [ 23 , 24 , 31 , 60 ]. MKs are PLT precursor cells, contain many of the same proteins and pathways as PLTs, and are often used as a relevant model system to study PLT responses [ 8 , 60 , 61 ]. While PLTs are only extremely difficult or not at all accessible to modifications of their transcriptome, MKs have been genetically modified using several different techniques [ 62 , 63 ]. Here, we used “liposome-based transfection” utilizing the transfer of in vitro transcribed, capped, and poly(A) tailed  NAP1L1  mRNA into MKs ( Figure 7 A), to induce transient overexpression of NAP1L1.  Figure 7 B demonstrates the successful overexpression of NAP1L1 protein in MKs. In contrast to PLTs isolated from septic patients, the exposure of human MKs to an agonist commonly generated during sepsis (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) did result in a slight decrease of the endogenous NAP1L1 protein level, independent of the transfection. In addition, treatment of transfected cells with LPS did also not lead to NAP1L1 protein levels above the non-LPS but transfected condition. We next analyzed proplatelet formation (PPF), an energy intensive hallmark functional determinate of MKs in NAP1L1 transfected cell cultures. We were able to show that NAP1L1 protein overexpression in non-treated cells, and even more pronounced in with LPS-treated cells, significantly decreased PPF ( Figure 7 C,D). Additional co-IP experiments using MKs demonstrated increased NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction when cells were exposed to LPS ( Supplementary Figure S3A ). Furthermore, consistent with the PPF data indicating decreased functional capacity of MKs under septic conditions, LPS treatment decreased the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity in our culture model ( Supplementary Figure S3B ). 3. Discussion The MK-PLT axis is increasingly recognized as being more intricate and sophisticated in cellular responsibilities and abilities than historically expected. MKs are not only producing PLTs in the bone marrow through thrombopoiesis but are also intimately involved in setting up the PLT immune potential. MKs invest PLTs with the molecular composition to take center stage as responders and immune sentinels in the initiation and propagation of coordinated host immune responses [ 64 ]. Furthermore, while PLTs are anucleate, it has been demonstrated that they contain a complex transcriptome [ 20 , 49 ] and regulatory pathways, including cytoplasmic splicing, controlling important biologic tasks [ 22 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 60 , 65 , 66 , 67 ]. In concert with these signal-dependent pathways, it was demonstrated that PLTs possess nuclear proteins. In a comprehensive PLT proteome analysis, 13% of all identified proteins were mapped to a nuclear location [ 68 ]. PLTs utilize such proteins in established functions, as well as assigning alternative roles. Amongst other nuclear proteins, MKs distribute a functional spliceosome to PLTs [ 23 , 24 ]. In addition, nuclear receptors, including the receptors for sex steroids, glucocorticoids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)s, and retinoid X receptors (RXR)s were detected in PLTs, reported to bind their respective ligands, which induce PLT aggregation and activation (reviewed in [ 69 ]). Unexpectedly, RAR was also demonstrated to be utilized by PLTs as a translational regulator [ 28 ]. RAR is additionally employed in non-genomic activities by controlling actin cytoskeletal events [ 31 ]. Nevertheless, there is paucity of data exploring and finally comparing the functional capacities of nuclear proteins in PLTs with their counterparts residing in MKs. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that  NAP1L1  mRNA is expressed in PLTs demonstrating potential transcript variants previously not detected in PLTs ( Figure 1  and  Figure 2 , and  Supplementary Figure S1 ). Furthermore, we identify a protein interaction partner, PDC-E2, hitherto not characterized as being part of the NAP1L1 protein network ( Figure 4 ). Using septic PLTs, we were able to also demonstrate a dynamic protein expression pattern of NAP1L1 and its interaction partner PDC-E2, potentially resulting in altered pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity ( Figure 5  and  Figure 6 ). In addition, using human MK cells, we were able to show that overexpression of NAP1L1 results in diminished proplatelet formation, and decreased PDC-E2-dependent PDH activity ( Figure 7  and  Supplementary Figure S3 ). Our analyses of MKs and PLTs are also the first to examine  NAP1L1  transcript levels and protein expression pattern. While  NAP1L1  mRNA was previously detected in human PLTs [ 49 , 70 ], no in-depth analysis of potential transcript variants, changes in transcript levels, or specific protein expression or localization analysis was performed.

Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 and 546 were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (G-21040, G-21234,  S11223 , A-11001, A-11008, A-21422, A-21428). 4.2. Septic Patients Patients were selected for meeting consensus criteria for sepsis [ 94 ], and enrolled within 48 h of ICU admission (n = 9, and 17, for septic and healthy, respectively). 4.3. PLT Isolation and Culture PLTs used for the described studies were freshly isolated. PLTs were leukocyte-reduced and isolated, as previously described to yield a highly purified population of cells with <1 leukocyte per 10 7  PLTs [ 23 , 24 , 66 ]. In addition, PLT activation during centrifugation steps was mitigated by the addition of 100 nM prostaglandin E1 (PGE-1) before each centrifugation step. Depleted PLTs were resuspended at 1 × 10 8 /mL in a serum-free M199 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11150067), placed in round-bottom polypropylene tubes, and incubated, where indicated, in a 37 °C humidified incubator at 5% CO 2  for different time points. In select studies, PLTs were placed on immobilized fibrinogen and stimulated with thrombin (factor IIa), as previously described [ 24 ]. 4.4. CD34 + -Derived MKs CD34 +  hematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and differentiated into proplatelet-producing MKs, as previously described [ 23 , 24 , 31 ]. 4.5. RNA Isolation MKs or PLTs were lysed in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), and RNA isolation was performed, as previously described [ 23 , 24 ].

CD34 + -Derived MKs and Freshly Isolated Human PLTs Express NAP1L1 We initially sought to determine RNA expression patterns of  NAP1L1  in CD34 +  hematopoietic progenitor cell-derived MKs and freshly isolated human PLTs. Next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that MKs and human PLTs express messenger RNA (mRNA) for  NAP1L1  ( Figure 1 A,B). Consistent with its expression demonstrated via RNA-seq,  NAP1L1  mRNA was also detected in MKs using PCR techniques ( Figure 1 C).  NAP1L1  was consistently expressed over the entire time course of MK culture and differentiation. Furthermore,  NAP1L1  was readily detectable in RNA samples isolated from human PLTs ( Figure 1 D). Of note, all PLT samples used for these studies were DNase treated to exclude any DNA contaminants from nucleated cells. Since multiple alternative transcripts are described to exist for  NAP1L1 , we next performed PCR experiments using a primer pair spanning from exon 1 to exon 7, enabling us to detect a potential alternative  NAP1L1  transcript variant 5, which is devoid of exons 3 and 4 ( Figure 2 A). MKs as well as PLT samples demonstrated the presence of PCR products indicative of  NAP1L1  transcript variant 1 ( Figure 2 B,C), PCR product band indicated at ~600 bp) and transcript variant 5 ( Figure 2 B,C, PCR product band indicated at ~400 bp). These findings were verified by Sanger sequencing for excised PCR products, demonstrating full length transcript as well as a transcript devoid of exon 3 and 4 (data not shown). In addition, we were able to detect  NAP1L1  transcript variants at all stages of MK differentiation ( Figure 2 B). Furthermore, allowing the incubation of PLTs overnight ( Figure 2 C), or the placement of PLTs on immobilized fibrinogen and stimulating the cells using thrombin ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) did not alter the expression pattern of alternative transcripts; therefore, no loading control was included. Consistent with our findings by PCR and Sanger sequencing ( Figure 1  and  Figure 2 , and data not shown), we found that NAP1L1 protein is endogenously and robustly expressed in situ in the cytoplasm and proplatelet extensions of MKs ( Figure 3 A). It is interesting to note that NAP1L1 protein localization in MKs is less pronounced in cell nuclei; however, it demonstrates some peri-nuclear enhancement. Furthermore, cells undergoing anaphase showed reduced NAP1L1 association with condensed chromosomes ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). While nucleosome assembly proteins were initially identified as being histone chaperones and chromatin-assembly factors, additional functions were assigned including tissue-specific transcription regulation, apoptosis, histone shuttling, cell-cycle regulation, and additional chaperone functions beyond histone binding [ 41 ]. Our microscopic findings in MKs could potentially point towards such extra nuclear functions. In unstimulated human PLTs, NAP1L1 protein concentrated and accumulated peri-granular (when compared with WGA co-staining) in a fine vesicular pattern ( Figure 3 B). Immunoblotting also confirmed our microscopic findings of NAP1L1 protein being present in MKs ( Figure 3 C). Surprisingly, Western blotting revealed three major protein bands at 60, 53 and 37 kDa, while the predicted size for NAP1L1 protein (expected isoform 1) is 43–53 kDa. Therefore, we sought to examine the specificity of the used anti-NAP1L1 antibody. A peptide competition assay (quench experiment) using the immunogenic peptide ( Figure 3 D, right) showed that all three detected protein bands specifically represent NAP1L1 isoforms or potentially post-translational modified NAP1L1 in human PLT samples ( Figure 3 D, left). 2.2.

In addition, nuclear receptors, including the receptors for sex steroids, glucocorticoids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)s, and retinoid X receptors (RXR)s were detected in PLTs, reported to bind their respective ligands, which induce PLT aggregation and activation (reviewed in [ 69 ]). Unexpectedly, RAR was also demonstrated to be utilized by PLTs as a translational regulator [ 28 ]. RAR is additionally employed in non-genomic activities by controlling actin cytoskeletal events [ 31 ]. Nevertheless, there is paucity of data exploring and finally comparing the functional capacities of nuclear proteins in PLTs with their counterparts residing in MKs. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that  NAP1L1  mRNA is expressed in PLTs demonstrating potential transcript variants previously not detected in PLTs ( Figure 1  and  Figure 2 , and  Supplementary Figure S1 ). Furthermore, we identify a protein interaction partner, PDC-E2, hitherto not characterized as being part of the NAP1L1 protein network ( Figure 4 ). Using septic PLTs, we were able to also demonstrate a dynamic protein expression pattern of NAP1L1 and its interaction partner PDC-E2, potentially resulting in altered pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity ( Figure 5  and  Figure 6 ). In addition, using human MK cells, we were able to show that overexpression of NAP1L1 results in diminished proplatelet formation, and decreased PDC-E2-dependent PDH activity ( Figure 7  and  Supplementary Figure S3 ). Our analyses of MKs and PLTs are also the first to examine  NAP1L1  transcript levels and protein expression pattern. While  NAP1L1  mRNA was previously detected in human PLTs [ 49 , 70 ], no in-depth analysis of potential transcript variants, changes in transcript levels, or specific protein ",
