Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Isolation is an important feature of the spaceflight environment. Interplanetary missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will involve mission crew operating in isolated environments for prolonged periods of time. On Earth, isolation has profound effects on the central nervous system (CNS) including behavioral changes, upregulated oxidative stress pathways, neuroinflammatory responses, as well as brain cytokine alterations 1 – 3 . In addition, isolation worsens aging-related cognitive impairments and immune deficits 4 . Spaceflight also can lead to immune dysfunction as well as reactivation of latent viruses 5 – 8 . International Space Station (ISS) crew members on a 6-month spaceflight mission had diminished T/NK cell function 9  and increased inflammatory plasma cytokine levels 10 . In shorter duration missions (9–14 days), changes in the distribution and function of peripheral leukocytes were also detected in astronauts 11 . Further, the subset of astronauts who experienced viral shedding also displayed increased plasma cytokine protein levels in their plasma during flight 12 , linking dysregulated cytokine levels with impaired immune function. We showed previously that isolation in combination with simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading (HU) led to a reduction in the percentage of circulating CD4+ immune cells, which was not observed in social housed HU animals 13 . This finding suggests that isolation can modify immune responses to simulated spaceflight and that the combination of these two spaceflight stressors can lead to discrete immune deficits. However, the combined effects of isolation and microgravity on neuroimmune outcomes are not defined. Excess production of free radicals (e.g., reactive oxygen species, ROS) have been linked to neuroinflammation 14 . Yet there have been few studies exploring oxidative damage as a mechanism by which space environmental factors, singly or in combination, mediate aspects of CNS immune responses. To address these gaps in knowledge, HU was conducted on paired (social) and single housed wild-type and MCAT mice, a genetic model for mitochondrial ROS quenching. MCAT mice overexpress the human catalase gene targeted to the mitochondria 15 , a major site of cellular ROS production. MCAT mice display decreased oxidative damage and H 2 O 2  production. The MCAT transgenic model 15  was developed to enable testing various aspects of the free radical theory of aging 16 , which posits that cells, tissues, and organisms age due to an accumulation of oxidative damage via excess production of ROS. Overexpression of catalase when targeted specifically to the mitochondria, but not when targeted to the nucleus or cytoplasm, prolongs murine lifespan and reduces age-related cardiovascular 17 – 19  and cognitive deficits 20  sharing features with known or anticipated effects of spaceflight 21 – 25 . Findings from human astronauts long ago led to the proposal that spaceflight and advancing age share physiological consequences 26 , leading us to question if they also share molecular mechanisms. Therefore, we determined whether the MCAT transgene also is protective using a ground-based model that simulates important aspects of spaceflight, microgravity, and isolation. MCAT mice show increased median and maximum lifespans (5 months, and 5.5 months, respectively) 15  and are protected from a number of aging-associated pathologies. For example, MCAT mice display protection from cardiovascular deficits 17 – 19  and Alzheimer’s disease-related amyloid deposition 27 . Further, the brains of MCAT mice indicate the rescue of simulated space radiation-induced decrements in neurogenesis 28  and neuronal spine morphology 29 . The overexpression of catalase also quenches mitochondrial oxidative stress in macrophages 30 , suggesting that catalase can impact oxidative signaling in inflammatory cells. MCAT mice also exhibit enhanced hippocampal spatial learning, memory, and reduced contextual fear conditioning 15 , 20 . Altered cognitive function is thought to be one of the risks associated with long-duration spaceflight 31 . The production of ROS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and neurotrophic factors are involved in hippocampal neuropathy. Prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity by HU is associated with increased hippocampal oxidative stress biomarkers, which may increase injury 32 . Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in HU mice reveals changes in structural proteins coupled with the loss of proteins involved in cell metabolism 33 . In addition, microgravity leads to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment in animals 34 . Cytokines are important mediators of both innate and adaptive immunity. They are produced by resident immune cells in the CNS, peripheral tissues, and in circulation 35 , 36 . There is emerging evidence that cytokines contribute to the detrimental effects of isolation triggered by disease or injury 37 , 38 . For example, hippocampal expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is significantly increased 24 h after ischemia in isolated mice compared to untreated controls, but not in pair-housed mice 37 , 38 . In humans as well as animals, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity (bedrest) can lead to changes in cytokine expression 10 , 12 , 39 – 42 . Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that isolation and simulated microgravity lead to altered hippocampal cytokine expression via mitochondrial ROS-related mechanisms. Hippocampal alterations, e.g., oxidative damage, spatial changes, and genetic alterations have been reported in both actual and modeled microgravity 32 , 43 – 46  and linked to behavioral deficits 47 . These higher CNS functions are critical for astronaut performance during extended periods of spaceflight. Therefore, the hippocampus was selected as the focus of the current study. We found that quenching mitochondrial ROS mitigated the effects of both simulated microgravity and isolation in the hippocampus. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of mitochondrial ROS mechanisms in CNS responses to these stressors, thereby providing a rationale for testing possible use of antioxidants to mitigate CNS risks associated with long-term space exploration as well as bedrest and isolation on Earth. Results Effects of isolation, microgravity and their combination on hippocampal cytokine levels We performed unbiased hierarchical clustering of cytokine protein expression to gain insight into the impacts of our main experimental variables, loading state (NL: normally loaded or HU), housing environment (single or social housing), and genotype (WT: wild type or MCAT) on the overall cytokine milieu in the hippocampus (Fig.  1 ). At the highest hierarchical level, samples generally clustered by housing conditions (single or social). Samples within the single housed cluster, formed sub-clusters mostly based on genotype (WT or MCAT), which was not observed in the social housed cluster. Loading state (NL or HU) did not appear to contribute to observed clustering of cytokine expression. Fig. 1 Heatmap showing expression of a panel of 44 cytokines in hippocampus and hierarchical clustering analysis of eight experimental groups. Except for a few samples, clustering generally occurred by housing environment (single or social). Deeper shades of red: higher cytokine levels, deeper shades of blue: lower cytokine levels, off-white: no change in expression. We first examined the effects of housing environment in all groups (Fig.  2 ). A comparison between single and social housed mice revealed marked effects of isolation in the hippocampus. Eleven out of 44 cytokines were elevated in wild-type, single housed mice versus the social-housed group (Fig.  2a  and Supplementary Table  3 ). These effects were mitigated in MCAT mice. IL-6 (Fig.  2b  and Supplementary Table  3 ) is provided as a representative example of the expression pattern evident amongst these 11 cytokines.

Here and in succeeding dot plots, the longer horizontal line in the dot plot corresponds to the group mean while the shorter horizontal lines depict the standard error (SE). Sample sizes are WT NL social ( n  = 6), WT NL single ( n  = 3), MCAT NL social ( n  = 6), and MCAT NL single ( n  = 4). Some data points overlap. A fit model was generated to include housing state, genotype, loading state, and their pairwise interactions. Interaction effects between housing state and genotype were assessed at  p  < 0.05. *Statistically significant at  p  < 0.05 by Tukey post hoc test. Next, we focused on the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype (as main factors and their interactions) on hippocampal cytokine expression in single housed mice (Fig.  3  and Supplementary Table  4 ). When exploring the effect of genotype (main factor) in single housed mice, we found differences in cytokine expression (Fig.  3a ), with 13 out of 44 cytokines showing reduced protein levels in single housed MCAT versus wild-type mice (Supplementary Table  5 ). HU downregulated IL-13 in WT mice. Interestingly, IL-13 levels were lower in MCAT NL mice than in WT NL mice. HU did not appear to cause any further decreases in IL-13 levels of MCAT animals, suggesting mitigation of cytokine changes (Fig.  3b  and Supplementary Table  4 ).

In social housed animals, simulated microgravity and transgene expression caused changes in the expression of five hippocampal cytokines (Fig.  4a ). Four out of these five cytokines (IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17) were upregulated in HU versus NL mice, and mitigated in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table  6 ). Results for IL-3 are shown as a representative example of the upregulated cytokines (Fig.  4b ). In contrast, (IL-12) was downregulated and this effect also was mitigated in MCAT animals (Supplementary Table  6 ). Some of the cytokines showed relatively low expression levels (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, refer to Supplementary Table  1  for full list of cytokines) relative to other cytokines in the panel. These results are consistent with values reported in other studies that suggest biologically relevant effects at these levels of expression 48 , 49 . Table  1  summarizes the results of cytokine analysis of hippocampus.

Effects of isolation, microgravity, and their combination on plasma cytokine levels The same 44-cytokine protein expression analysis was performed on blood plasma to assess possible system-wide effects of simulated microgravity and isolation. Cytokine expression patterns in the plasma differed markedly from those observed in the hippocampus. Figure  5a  shows the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype on cytokine plasma expression in single housed mice. In single housed mice, HU upregulated expression of IL-20 and IFN-β1, whereas these effects were not observed in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table  7 ). In contrast, HU downregulated MDC (macrophage-derived chemokine), which also was mitigated in MCAT mice (Fig.  5b  and Supplementary Table  7 ). Fractalkine showed a genotype effect (Supplementary Table  8 ). Fig. 5 Effects of combined isolation and simulated microgravity and the impact of MCAT genotype on plasma cytokine expression (single housed groups only). a  Diagram showing the effect of simulated microgravity and genotype on plasma cytokine expression in single housed animals. Three cytokines were differentially expressed in plasma of single housed HU versus NL mice and mitigated in MCAT HU mice. MDC was downregulated (italics) while IL-20 and IFN-β1 were upregulated.  b  Representative graph showing IFN-β1, one of the two cytokines elevated by HU and mitigated in MCAT mice. NL WT ( n  = 6), HU WT ( n  = 5), NL MCAT ( n  = 6), and U MCAT ( n  = 6). Some data points overlap. *Statistically significant at  p  < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test. In social housed groups (excluding isolation as a factor), there was a twofold increase in IL-20 protein levels in the plasma of HU mice compared to NL controls. This effect was mitigated in MCAT mice (Fig.  6  and Supplementary Table  9 ). Within the 44 cytokines tested, isolation showed less impact on plasma cytokine expression levels than observed in the hippocampus. Fig. 6 Effect of simulated microgravity (without isolation) and genotype on the expression of plasma cytokines (social housed groups only). a  One cytokine, IL-20, was elevated due to HU in plasma of social housed mice and this effect is mitigated in MCAT animals.  b  Graph showing protein expression of IL-20 in plasma of WT and MCAT animals exposed to HU. Sample size is  n  = 6/group. Some data points overlap. *Statistically significant at  p  < 0.05 by two-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test. Isolation affected only two cytokines in plasma—Eotaxin and MDC (Fig.  7 ). These cytokines were upregulated in single housed animals and unchanged in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table  10 ). Refer to Table  1  for a summary of results from plasma cytokine analysis. Fig. 7 Effect of isolation on plasma cytokines. a  Isolation elevates the levels of Eotaxin and MDC in plasma and are not mitigated in MCAT mice.  b  Representative graph (Eotaxin) showing the effects of isolation on plasma cytokines and no mitigation in MCAT mice. WT NL social ( n  = 6), WT NL single ( n  = 6), MCAT NL social ( n  = 7), and MCAT NL single ( n  = 6). Some data points overlap. A fit model was created and included housing state, genotype and loading state, and their pairwise interactions. Interaction effects between housing state and genotype were assessed at  p  < 0.05. Assessment of corticosterone levels in plasma To begin investigating possible underlying stress-related mechanisms, we measured plasma corticosterone levels in all groups (Supplementary Fig.  2  and Supplementary Table  11 ). Corticosterone levels were generally higher in the social groups compared to their corresponding single housed groups (only WT single vs WT social housed HU groups showed no differences). We previously reported that HU of wild-type animals led to increased corticosterone levels 13 . In the current study, we found that single housed MCAT mice were protected from HU-induced increases in corticosterone levels. Interestingly, social housed MCAT NL mice had higher corticosterone levels versus social housed WT NL mice. However, HU in social housed MCAT mice did not lead to additional increases in corticosterone levels relative to the social MCAT NL group. Refer to Table  1  for a summary of corticosterone results. Measurements of oxidative damage in hippocampus Changes in inflammatory status have been linked to differences in oxidative damage 50 , 51 . To determine whether isolation or simulated microgravity caused oxidative damage in the hippocampus, we measured 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adduct levels. Single housed WT animals generally showed higher levels of 4-HNE compared to social housed WT mice (Supplementary Fig.  3A , and Supplementary Table  12 ). In contrast, 4-HNE levels of single versus social housed MCAT groups were generally comparable. Further, no HU effect was observed (Supplementary Table  13 ). Discussion Although not in complete solitude, human crew in deep space missions will experience prolonged exposure to environments isolated from Earth and larger social groups. Using a rodent model, we assessed the consequence of isolation alone or in combination with simulated microgravity on the CNS cytokine milieu, a key component of the neuroimmune response. In addition, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial ROS signaling contributed to cytokine responses in the CNS focusing on the hippocampus. Spaceflight is known to cause dysfunction in a variety of tissues 52 – 57 . Various regions of the CNS are negatively impacted by microgravity and its simulations. For example, 14 days of HU increased acetylcholine activity in both hippocampus and cortex, which was linked to inferior behavior performances 47 , 58 . Our results suggest that isolation is an important stimulus that can evoke changes in the cytokine milieu of the hippocampus, with 11 of 44 immune-modulating cytokines tested showing increased protein expression due to isolation. We also found that compared to social housed mice, isolation increased 4-HNE, an indicator of oxidative damage. Together, these findings indicate that isolation can alter aspects of CNS immune signaling and lead to increased oxidative damage in the CNS. Changes in cytokine signaling in the CNS have been linked to neuroinflammation, neurocognitive decline, reduced ability to recover from brain injuries as well as neuroprotective effects. For example, genetic deletion of IL-6 leads to reduced exploratory behavior and decreased anxiety 59 . Deletion of IL-2 in mice leads to cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of Alzheimer’s disease 60  while disruption of Toll-like receptor signaling by knockou",

  "methods": "Materials and methods Animals and strains Female wild-type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice were included in this study. MCAT mice overexpress human catalase localized to the mitochondria 15 . Wild type (WT) and MCAT mice for use in the experiments were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by crossing male MCAT mice, B6.Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ mice (from Jackson Laboratory; stocks 016197 and 005304, respectively). Genotyping was performed using the Red’N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore-Sigma). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at ARC. The approved animal protocols associated with this study are NAS-16-006 and NAS-16-007. Hindlimb unloading Sixteen-week-old female wild-type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT mice on C57BL/6NJ background were assigned to one of eight experimental groups, and housed either individually (single housed) or in pairs (social housed) (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Females were selected for this study in part because the majority of rodent studies to date on simulated and actual weightlessness have used females. The wild-type groups in this study were the same animals used in our previous report which focused on the assessment of musculoskeletal outcomes and flow cytometry-based immune cell profiling in response to isolation 13 . The traditional NASA Ames HU cage system was used for single housed HU animals 77 , while normally loaded (NL) single housed controls were maintained single housed in standard vivarium cages. A separate validation experiment confirmed that NL mice housed in standard vivarium cages or in HU cages did not differ in body weights, plasma corticosterone levels, soleus mass, bone structure, and immune cell populations in peripheral blood (data not shown). A custom caging system as we had previously described 13 , was used for social housed, HU mice (pairs). Social housed, NL controls were maintained in standard vivarium cages in pairs as controls for the social HU mice. Animals assigned to HU groups were acclimated for 3 days in HU cages but without unloading, prior to the onset of HU. Room temperature was maintained at a range of 23–24 °C with a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Nestlests (Ancare) were provided as enrichment for the animals. Animal weights and food consumption were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment. Animals were euthanized 30 days after the onset of HU via CO 2  inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Sample collection and analysis HU was initiated across three consecutive days with equal numbers of wild-type and MCAT mice (similar ages) on any given day to accommodate the large number of animals in this study. All experimental groups experienced the same length of treatments (e.g., HU). Consequently, dissections were performed across 3 consecutive days. The left brain hemisphere was flash ",

Taken together, findings from our study and others suggest that isolation poses a risk to CNS health. Isolation and HU led to discrete sets of differentially expressed cytokines in hippocampus, suggesting different immunoregulatory mechanisms invoked by each of these stressors. Collectively, the cytokines differentially expressed in response to HU or isolation as single factors are known to play roles in immune regulation, inflammatory disease and also are impacted by spaceflight. (Refer to ref.  62  for a recent review on the functions of interleukins and other cytokines). For example, circulating IL-20 protein levels (elevated by HU in our current study) are also increased at the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis and decreased after 6 months of treatment 63 , 64 . Further, IL-3 protein levels are greater in splenocytes and thymocytes from space-flown rats than ground controls 65 . In peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from astronauts onboard the ISS, IL-10 is reduced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation compared to controls 7 .
