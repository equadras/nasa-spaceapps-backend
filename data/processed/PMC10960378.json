  "abstract": "Background The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO 2  levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is  Enterobacter bugandensis , primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections. Results Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS  E. bugandensis  strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug-resistant  E. bugandensis  were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived  E. bugandensis  in comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of  E. bugandensis  across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of  E. bugandensis  in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongside  E. bugandensis  in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS. Conclusions Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of  E. bugandensis  within the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats. \n Video Abstract Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-024-01777-1.",

The International Space Station (ISS), a highly controlled built environment harbouring extreme conditions such as microgravity, solar radiation, and elevated CO 2  levels, offers a unique place for studying microbial survival and adaptation [ 1 ]. Recent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms exposed to microgravity can acquire antibiotic resistance and heightened virulence via rapid mutations and horizontal gene transfer [ 2 – 4 ]. Prolonged space travel under microgravity can also compromise astronauts’ immune systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases [ 5 ]. The microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact astronauts’ microbiomes and get replenished by the arrival of new crew [ 6 ]. Thus, understanding microbial colonisation, succession, and interactions is pivotal for ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial risks in isolated and confined human habitats. Persistent efforts have been made to monitor the ISS microbiome through multiple microbial tracking missions [ 3 ,  7 ], identifying novel microorganisms [ 8 – 11 ], studying antibiotic resistance [ 12 ] to unveiling microbial interactions [ 13 ]. Enterobacter bugandensis , a newly recognised species, emerges as one of the important opportunistic pathogens within the  Enterobacter  genus and has been isolated predominantly from clinical specimens [ 14 ,  15 ]. Species from this Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic genus exist in various environments, from soil to the human gut [ 16 ]. In addition, some  Enterobacter  species act as opportunistic human pathogens, causing nosocomial infections with bacteremia, lower respiratory tract, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and urinary tract infection [ 17 ]. Moreover, with time,  Enterobacter  isolates have been shown to manifest multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms, including extended-spectrum  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\beta$$\\end{document} β -lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, AmpC overexpression, and altered membrane permeability [ 18 ], and have been designated as a member of ESKAPE pathogen group, recognised for their antimicrobial resistance prowess. Interestingly, recent studies have reported the isolation of 13 multi-drug resistant  E. bugandensis  strains from the ISS during the Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) mission [ 1 ,  19 ]. Motivated by the presence of  E. bugandensis  on the ISS, our central aim was to compare ISS-derived  E. bugandensis  genomes with their terrestrial counterparts, with an emphasis on clinical isolates. We trace the evolutionary dynamics of pivotal genes, including those involved in putative functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, possibly driven by the unique stresses of space. Expanding our investigations, we further examined metagenomic reads to map the prevalence of  E. bugandensis  across diverse ISS locations, capturing its temporal dynamics. In addition, we explored the coexisting microbial communities of  E. bugandensis  in ISS across multiple flights and locations. Subsequently, the intricate microbial interactions of  E. bugandensis  within the ISS were unveiled using a combination of robust computational approaches. This comprehensive analysis (Fig.  1 ) not only sheds light on how these interactions influence microbial diversity and contribute to the potential succession of  E. bugandensis  within the unique ISS habitat but also aids in designing strategic preventive measures against infections caused by pathogens. Fig. 1 Illustrative workflow showcasing the process of comparative genomics analysis of  E. bugandensis , evaluating its prevalence and metabolic interactions within the microbial community, and its successful adaptation within the ISS habitat Results Phylogenetic distinction of ISS  E. bugandensis  from terrestrial isolates We obtained 211 assembled genomes, annotated as  E. bugandensis , from the publicly available National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI) GenBank sequence database [ 20 ]. Among these genomes, 12 were isolated from three different locations aboard the ISS during the first Flight of the MT-1 mission: four from the Air Control (AC) samples, one from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and seven from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Additionally, one metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was recovered from the WHC samples. To ensure the taxonomic affiliation of these genomes, we calculated the average nucleotide identity (ANI) by comparing them to the  E. bugandensis  type-strain EB-247 T  (= DSM 29888 T ) [ 14 ]. The ANI values of all 211 strains examined ranged from 97.74 to 100%, confirming their species-level taxonomic affiliation (> 95%) [ 21 ]. The genomes isolated from the ISS exhibited an average ANI of 98.61%. Furthermore, we observed that  E. bugandensis  was predominantly isolated from human hosts, accounting for approximately 81% of all isolates, followed by non-human hosts/environmental sources (11%). Detailed information on the genomes, including their isolation sources, ANI, as well as other relevant aspects, are presented in Supplementary Table  1 . We employed four different phylogeny construction methods, including single-copy core gene-based ( n  = 172 marker genes) and SNP-based approaches and found that the ISS genomes formed a separate clade from strains present in other Earth environments and hosts (Figs.  2  and  3 , Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Notably, one strain, AR1358 from Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang, China, clustered closely with the ISS isolates across all trees. To investigate deeper into the ISS strains’ placement, we compared them to the  E. bugandensis  type-strain EB-247 T  and closely related human isolate, AR1358, at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and other mutational levels. The ISS isolates showed an average of 36,044 (s.d. = 24.04) SNPs compared to the type-strain. We found that ISS strains had significantly more SNPs (Wilcoxon rank sum test,  p -value = 0.019) than the closely associated human isolates (strains in the right panel of Fig.  2 ). A comparative analysis of ISS strains with the closest Earth strain, AR1358, revealed significant differences of 3238 SNPs, 14 indels, and 578 complex mutations on average. However, these genetic variations were evenly observed among the isolates. An SNP-based tree showed the ISS isolates form a separate clade even from the closest Earth strain, indicating isolates from other sources (e.g. leaves, human urine, seawater) did not cluster with ISS strains in our SNP-based analysis (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). These results reveal that  E. bugandensis  strains from the ISS show notable genetic differences compared to their Earth counterparts. This prompted us to investigate deeper into the comparative genomics, antimicrobial traits, and functional features of ISS strains, especially in relation to other microorganisms they coexist with. Fig. 2 Phylogenetic tree of  E. bugandensis  constructed using 172 marker genes of  Gammaproteobacteria  showing the distinct clade of ISS isolates/MAG apart from the other Earth-based isolation sources. The clade with 32 genomes, which includes 12 ISS isolates and one MAG, is highlighted in the right-side panel \n Fig. 3 Hierarchical clustering visualisation depicting the functional profiles of  E. bugandensis  based on COG annotations. In this figure, columns represent COGs, and rows represent individual samples. The pointed yellow box indicates the COGs specifically present in the genomes of the ISS strains \n E. bugandensis  strains isolated from the ISS might have evolved functionally under extreme conditions We identified and annotated every open reading frame (ORFs, i.e. coding sequences of isolated genomes) in each of the 211 genomes/MAG. Our analysis yielded a total of 945,562 coding sequences (CDS) with 2660 distinct Clusters of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotations. Although the above-mentioned phylogenetic analyses suggested genetic variations in the  E. bugandensis  strains from the ISS, they did not clarify how these variations translate into functional changes. A comparative analysis of COGs across all 211 genomes revealed that the ISS genomes exhibited a relatively higher average gene count in categories such as amino acid transport and metabolism, mobilome (prophages and transposons), and transcription factors (Supplementary Table  1 ). To better understand these COG patterns, we constructed a presence–absence matrix for unique COGs across the genomes, followed by hierarchical clustering. This approach also identified a distinct clade formed by the ISS genomes, indicating not only genetic divergence but also functional distinctiveness compared to other  E. bugandensis  strains (Fig.  3 ). We further identified 14 COGs exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100%) while being rarely detected in Earth genomes (< 10%). These encompass a range of functions, including amino acid transport and metabolism (COG2423), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (COG0464, COG4678), mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545), transcription (COG0454, COG0864), and others with yet unknown or predicted functions. For a comprehensive understanding, we constructed a pan-genome comprising 13,936 gene clusters, including 3836 core and 10,100 accessory gene clusters across all isolated  E. bugandensis  strains (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). The ISS genomes exhibited an average of 4568 genes, a significantly higher count than the average of 4416 genes found in the Earth genomes. Focusing on the additional genes, we similarly identified a distinct subset exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100% present in ISS genomes and < 10% in Earth genomes). This subset comprised 82 non-hypothetical genes, though annotations for these genes remained limited. This subset included genes such as alanine racemase, biosynthetic ( alr ), lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding periplasmic protein ( argT ), fragments of the astCADBE operon, and others pivotal in amino acid transport and metabolism. Additionally, a prevalence of transcriptional regulator genes observed, including HTH-type transcriptional repressors ( comR ,  rspR ,  yahB ,  nimR ,  yhjB ,  yybR ), transcriptional repressor PifC, and pentachlorophenol (PCP) degradation transcriptional activation protein. We also noticed the presence of essential elements such as the two-component regulatory system BvgAS, known for its pivotal role in controlling the expression of virulence factors and genes crucial for bacterial adaptation and pathogenicity. Furthermore, stress-associated genes like antitoxin components of the type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system (antitoxin HigA, antitoxin SocA, antitoxin ParD1, toxin ParE1) and SOS response systems (LexA repressor, ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4) were notable findings. Transporters also featured prominently in that gene set, encompassing histidine transport system permease proteins ( hisM ,  hisP ,  hisQ ), octopine transport system permease protein occM, inner membrane transport protein YdhP, and glutamine transport ATP-binding protein GlnQ ( glnQ ). These observations motivated a comprehensive gene-level pan-genome association study with the aim of unravelling the genes linked with  E. bugandensis  in the ISS. Effectively accounting for population stratification due to shared lineages, we performed genome-wide associations among 4696 gene sequences, ranging from 5 to 100% occurrence across all genomes. Importantly, our study further underscored the significant association of previously identified genes, from the pan-genome study, with ISS adaptation after adjustments for false discovery rates ( \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$p_{BH} <$$\\end{document} p BH <  0.001) (Supplementary Table  1 ). Presence of antibiotic resistance genes and mechanisms in ISS  E. bugandensis In the  E. bugandensis  genomes collected from the ISS, we looked for antibiotic resistance genes using the CARD database [ 22 ] and calculated sequence identity with the reference databases (Supplementary Table  1 ). We found that these genomes harbour resistance to 23 different multidrug classes, including cephalosporin, cephamycin, fluoroquinolone, and nitroimidazole antibiotics. Notably, a gene from the ACT  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\beta$$\\end{document} β -lactamase family (ACT-77) was present across all 13 genomes, exhibiting 99.48% sequence identity and 100% coverage. Additionally, we identified other MDR genes, such as cyclic AMP receptor protein (Crp), fosfomycin resistance gene (fosA2), and histone-like protein H-NS (H-NS), showing sequence identities of 99.05%, 96.45%, and 95.59%, respectively. Further, a total of 35 antibiotic resistance ontologies (ARO) were predicted across almost all the ISS  E. bugandensis  genomes. We then looked into the mechanism of antibiotic resistance and identified four mechanisms: antibiotic target alteration, antibiotic efflux, reduced permeability to antibiotics, and antibiotic inactivation. Moreover, certain organisms utilised combinations of these mechanisms to gain resistance against the antibiotics. However, these genes and mechanisms are not exclusive to ISS strains and are found in other Earth species as well (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Since the ISS genomes are closely associated with the human isolates (Fig.  2 ), these findings raise concerns about potential significant antibiotic resistance within the ISS environment. Microbial co-occurrence network reveals potential succession of  E. bugandensis  in ISS Next, we focused on investigating the potential succession of  E. bugandensis  in the challenging environment of the ISS. To achieve this, we conducted a detailed analysis of metagenomic reads derived from 42 samples collected during the MT-1 mission and assessed the abundance of  E. bugandensis  in the ISS (details in the “ Methods ” section). Further, we segregated the samples into two groups based on the samples treated with and without propidium monoazide (PMA). Our analysis revealed the evidence of potential succession of  E. bugandensis  across the environments within the ISS during multiple flights (Fig.  4 , Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Being interested in understanding microbial interactions, we focused on the samples treated with PMA, to account only for viable and intact microorganisms [ 23 ]. During Flight 1,  E. bugandensis  demonstrated substantial abundance in four distinct locations (1, 2, 3, and 5). This prevalence underwent a reduction during the subsequent Flight 2, with only two locations (3 and 5) displaying its presence. We further noticed a resurgence in the prevalence of  E. bugandensis  during the third flight, being present in all sampled locations. The highest abundance of  E. bugandensis  was observed in Location 2 (forward side panel wall of the WHC) during Flight 1 (relative abundance = 86.7%). However, the median of the absolute read counts for  E. bugandensis  was less during Flight 1 (1530) when compared to Flight 2 (1698) and Flight 3 (2673). Sampling at precise locations identified during Flight 1 facilitated continuity in the microbial monitoring carried out in Flights 2 and 3. This approach was instrumental in decoding the microbial succession patterns on the surfaces within the ISS. The emergence of novel microbial populations may correlate with the crew transition from Flight 2 to Flight 3. An earlier study by Checinska et al. had reported that no environmental parameters had been altered during the flights [ 1 ]. Fig. 4  Metagenomic analysis reveals the prevalence of  E. bugandensis  and other Enterobacteriaceae within the ISS environment.  A   Variation in the abundance of  E. bugandensis  is shown across flights and treatment categories (PMA vs. non-PMA), aggregating all locations.  B  Comparison between  E. bugandensis  reads (in blue) and other Enterobacteriaceae reads (in red) across distinct locations of ISS (with a confirmed presence of  E. bugandensis )  Moving forward, we probed into the microbial communities coexisting with  E. bugandensis  within the ISS environments. We focused on bacteria that displayed a relative abundance of > 1% alongside  E. bugandensis  in the metagenomic samples. This analysis revealed several patterns in the microbial co-occurring networks, as shown in Fig.  5 . During Flight 1, we observed distinct microbial dominance among the four locations where  E. bugandensis  was prevalent. For instance, Location 1 was characterised by a prevalence of  Klebsiella , Location 3 by  Methylobacterium , and Location 5 by  Pantoea , while  E. bugandensis  itself held dominance in Location 2. However, during Flight 2,  E. bugandensis  presence was limited to Locations 3 and 5. In Location 3, we noticed an exciting abundance of Gram-positive bacteria, including  Corynebacterium  sp. sy039,  Cutibacterium acnes ,  Paenibacillus polymyxa ,  Staphylococcus epidermidis , and  Streptococcus  sp. oral taxon 431. In contrast, Location 5 was dominated by members of the Erwiniaceae family, such as  Erwinia  and  Pantoea  species. While the abundance profile of  E. bugandensis  remained almost consistent across ISS flights, during Flight 3,  E. bugandensis  showed its adaptability, occupying nearly all ISS locations (Fig.  4 B). A family-level diversity analysis highlighted the continued dominance of the Erwiniaceae family, particularly the  Pantoea  genus, in most locations (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Nevertheless, Location 3 exhibited significant abundance of Staphylococcaceae. The details of absolute and relative abundances of organisms and their co-presence network are provided in Supplementary Table  2 .\n Fig. 5 The panel illustrates the co-presence networks ( n = 3) of microorganisms that inhabit locations with a relative abundance > 1%. The hexagonal nodes represent ISS locations, while circular nodes symbolise the microorganisms. Microbial nodes are colour-coded with grey, indicating microorganisms present in multiple locations. The size of the node corresponds to the number of locations  E. bugandensis ) E. bugandensis  potentially influences metabolic dynamics of coexisting microorganisms We further investigated the metabolic interactions among these co-occurring microorganisms of  E. bugandensis . For this, we constructed 47 genome-scale metabolic models and simulated them on the described media (details in the “ Methods ” section). To evaluate the effect of the surrounding bacteria on  E. bugandensis  metabolism, we calculated the pairwise Metabolic Support Index (MSI) for 957 identified communities. MSI is a directional measure that indicates the gain in metabolic potential of a microorganism while in a community compared to its isolated state. In our findings, we observed 645 nonzero MSI interactions ranging from 0.069 to 1.061%. Specifically focusing on the predicted interactions involving  E. bugandensis , we noticed that it can provide significant metabolic benefits to Gram-positive microorganisms (Fig.  6 A). Notably,  Staphylococcus saprophyticus  from Flight 1, Location 1, received the highest MSI of 1.06% among others, followed closely by  Staphylococcus hominis  (0.96%) at Flig",
  "introduction": "Introduction Microorganisms within built environments profoundly affect the health of inhabitants. The International Space Station (ISS), a highly controlled built environment harbouring extreme conditions such as microgravity, solar radiation, and elevated CO 2  levels, offers a unique place for studying microbial survival and adaptation [ 1 ]. Recent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms exposed to microgravity can acquire antibiotic resistance and heightened virulence via rapid mutations and horizontal gene transfer [ 2 – 4 ]. Prolonged space travel under microgravity can also compromise astronauts’ immune systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases [ 5 ]. The microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact astronauts’ microbiomes and get replenished by the arrival of new crew [ 6 ]. Thus, understanding microbial colonisation, succession, and interactions is pivotal for ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial risks in isolated and confined human habitats. Persistent efforts have been made to monitor the ISS microbiome through multiple microbial tracking missions [ 3 ,  7 ], identifying novel microorganisms [ 8 – 11 ], studying antibiotic resistance [ 12 ] to unveiling microbial interactions [ 13 ]. Enterobacter bugandensis , a newly recognised species, emerges as one of the important opportunistic pathogens within the  Enterobacter  genus and has been isolated predominantly from clinical specimens [ 14 ,  15 ]. Species from this Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic genus exist in various environments, from soil to the human gut [ 16 ]. In addition, some  Enterobacter  species act as opportunistic human pathogens, causing nosocomial infections with bacteremia, lower respiratory tract, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and urinary tract infection [ 17 ].

Interestingly, recent studies have reported the isolation of 13 multi-drug resistant  E. bugandensis  strains from the ISS during the Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) mission [ 1 ,  19 ]. Motivated by the presence of  E. bugandensis  on the ISS, our central aim was to compare ISS-derived  E. bugandensis  genomes with their terrestrial counterparts, with an emphasis on clinical isolates. We trace the evolutionary dynamics of pivotal genes, including those involved in putative functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance",
  "methods": "Methods Collection and classification of  E. bugandensis  genomes In this study, we utilised publicly available annotated genomes of  E. bugandensis  (NCBI taxonomic ID 881260) from the NCBI GenBank sequence database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ , accessed on July 17, 2023) using command line tools NCBI Entrez Direct (EDirect) and bit [ 56 ]. We downloaded 211 genomes, including 12 genomes of ISS strains and one MAG generated from the metagenome during the Microbial Tracking-1 mission. To identify the source of these isolates, we manually explored the NCBI BioSample database and classified them into four consistent categories—Human, Non-human/ Environmental, ISS, and Unknown isolates. To ensure taxonomic identification and relatedness of the genomes, we employed the FastANI v.1.33 tool to calculate pairwise ANI for each downloaded genome [ 57 ]. The reference strain used for ANI calculation was the  E. bugandensis  type-strain EB-247 T  (NCBI assembly ID GCF_900324475.1, available at  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMEA104711314/ ), which was originally isolated from the neonatal blood of a patient in Tanzania [ 14 ]. Phylogeny and SNP identification We used the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based command-line tool, GToTree v.1.6.31 [ 58 ], to construct the phylogenetic tree of the  E. bugandensis  genomes. The tree was built at strain level using the single-copy gene (SCG)-set HMM of  Gammaproteobacteria  targeting 172 marker genes. We subsequently employed interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v.6.7 [ 59 ] for visualisation and annotation of the tree. We excluded strain e1342 (NCBI assembly ID GCF_900075565.1) from our further analyses, as it appeared as an outlier in the phylogenetic tree. For the ISS strains and its close Earth-bound isolates (as shown in Fig.  2 , we computed the SNPs through a core-SNP set using Snippy v.4.6.0 ( https://github.com/tseemann/snippy ) by mapping assembled contigs to annotated type-strain. Snippy uses Burrows-Wheelers Aligner and SAMtools v.1.3.1 for alignment and FreeBayes to identify variants across the provided genomes. We further ran Gubbins v.3.2.1 for recombination-removal and FastTree v.2.1.11 with the generalised time-reversible (GTR) model for tree-building on the output from Snippy to produce the phylogenetic tree shown in Supplementary Fig.  1 A. Identifying ISS-associated genomic features of  E. bugandensis To identify and annotate the ORFs in the genomes of  E. bugandensis , we utilised Prokka v.1.14.6, which employs Prodigal for gene prediction [ 60 ]. Prokka’s standard automated pipeline annotated the genomes based on multiple reference databases. We employed the Python package cogclassifier v.1.0.5 ( https://pypi.org/project/cogclassifier/ ) to identify and classify COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes) from the Prokka annotated genomes. We applied the graph-based algorithm Panaroo v.1.3.2 in strict mode, employing specific parameters (including a sequence identity threshold of 0.7, a c",

Among these genomes, 12 were isolated from three different locations aboard the ISS during the first Flight of the MT-1 mission: four from the Air Control (AC) samples, one from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and seven from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Additionally, one metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was recovered from the WHC samples. To ensure the taxonomic affiliation of these genomes, we calculated the average nucleotide identity (ANI) by comparing them to the  E. bugandensis  type-strain EB-247 T  (= DSM 29888 T ) [ 14 ].

An SNP-based tree showed the ISS isolates form a separate clade even from the closest Earth strain, indicating isolates from other sources (e.g. leaves, human urine, seawater) did not cluster with ISS strains in our SNP-based analysis (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). These results reveal that  E. bugandensis  strains from the ISS show notable genetic differences compared to their Earth counterparts. This prompted us to investigate deeper into the comparative genomics, antimicrobial traits, and functional features of ISS strains, especially in relation to other microorganisms they coexist with.

  "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we discussed the adaptation of a multidrug-resistant, nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen,  E. bugandensis , in the unique built environment of the ISS, and its potential succession. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of microorganisms on ISS surfaces associated with humans, including opportunistic pathogens and discussed the importance of studying them [ 1 ,  3 ].  E. bugandensis , which is also an opportunistic pathogen, was observed to be present in the ISS during the cataloguing of viable microbial communities [ 1 ,  19 ]. Such organisms pose potential threats to astronauts on the ISS, though the exact mechanisms behind their behaviour in space remain unknown. The impact on astronaut health would likely depend on individual health status and how these microorganisms function in extreme space environments. Hence, it is crucial to explore genomic and metabolic studies to understand the functionality of these microorganisms and their potential implications for astronaut well-being. While some attempts have been made to understand the effect of pathogens like  A. pittii  [ 25 ] and  K. pneumoniae  [ 13 ,  26 ] under stress conditions on the ISS, there is still much more to explore. In this study, we have not limited our analyses to a mere comparison between Earth and ISS isolates of  E. bugandensis . Instead, we adopted a unique threefold approach to unravel the potential succession of  E. bugandensis  in the ISS. Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis to identify the genomic and functionality changes acquired by  E. bugandensis  during its adaptation to the extreme space environment. Secondly, we quantified the abundance of  E. bugandensis  in the ISS across multiple flights of the MT-1 mission. Additionally, we looked into the coexisting microbial population of  E. bugandensis  through a detailed metagenomic analysis. Lastly, we elucidated the metabolic interactions of these organisms and how they contribute to shaping the community structure within the ISS. Through this multi-faceted approach, we were able to explain the survival and dynamics of  E. bugandensis  in the ISS environment. Recent studies have also indicated the potential role of increased amino acid biosynthesis in the successful colonisation of stressed environments by bacteria such as  Salmonella , which is also from the Enterobacteriaceae family [ 27 ]. Another operon, astCADBE, known to be involved in arginine and ornithine transport and metabolism, was present in ISS strains and plays a significant role in virulence in enteric pathogens through arginine catabolism [ 28 ]. Furthermore, we identified the gene encoding alanine racemase, a key enzyme transforming L-alanine to D-alanine—an essential step in cell wall biosynthesis. Under stress, this enzyme might play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation and survival by facilitating D-alanine production for cell wall repair and maintenance [ 29 ]. Moreover, the higher prevalence of",
  "conclusion": "Conclusion In this study, we presented a robust and comprehensive methodology to decipher the survival mechanisms of the clinically significant microorganism,  E. bugandensis , within the challenging environment of the ISS. Through a synergistic integration of genomics, metagenomics, and metabolic modelling, we unravelled the potential strategies employed by  E. bugandensis  for adaptation and persistence in the unique ISS ecosystem. Our approach holds promise for broader applications, especially in terrestrial controlled settings such as hospital ICUs and surgical theatres. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of microbial dynamics in extreme environments, laying a solid foundation for future hypotheses and expanding the horizons of microbial ecology research."
