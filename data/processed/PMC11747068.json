  "abstract": "Background Prolonged spaceflight is known to cause vascular deconditioning and remodeling. Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded rats. Methods Firstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package “Cellchat” was used to reveal ligand-receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading. Results Clustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling process under simulated microgravity conditions. Conclusions This study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also included in this work. The findings provide a reference for future research on vascular deconditioning following long-duration spaceflight.

  "full_text": "Introduction With the increasing frequency of long-duration spaceflights, astronauts are confronted with a myriad of harsh conditions, including radiation, microgravity and circadian rhythm disruptions. These factors precipitate a cascade of cardiovascular changes, initially characterized by fluid shifts from the lower limbs to the head. Subsequent phenomena include decreased circulatory blood volume, diminished diastolic arterial pressure, reduced left ventricular dimensions, and post-flight orthostatic intolerance. Furthermore, there is evidence of accelerated physiological aging in the CA, which appears to be reversible [ 1 ]. The structural and functional vascular deconditioning observed in spaceflight has been attributed to alterations in the arterial wall. Studies have documented increased arterial stiffness and reduced compliance in the CA following 6 months of spaceflight, along with increased intima-media thickness in both CA and FA [ 2 ]. Several molecular regulators such as osteopontin [ 3 ], nuclear factor kappa B [ 4 ], and acid sphingomyelinase [ 5 ], have been implicated in the regional-specific arterial remodeling induced by weightlessness. However, a systematic genetic and molecular explanation for these vascular changes remains elusive. The vascular tissue is made up of several types of cells such as ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, macrophages, which exhibit different responsiveness to simulated microgravity. Traditional molecular biology techniques have struggled to discern the differential cellular responses to weightless environments, despite previous transcriptomic analyses of the vasculature under microgravity. While ECs and SMCs have been the focus of much research, the roles of fibroblasts and macrophages in vascular remodeling under simulated microgravity have not been well-defined. The advent of scRNA-seq has enabled the exploration of transcriptional heterogeneity across various vascular cell types. In this study, we conducted scRNA-seq on CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of tail suspension and compared them to age-matched controls under normal gravity conditions. This approach aimed to elucidate artery-specific and cell type-specific molecular signatures, identify key cell sub-clusters, assess intercellular communication networks, and identify important transcription factors. Our findings may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the structural and functional vascular changes observed in space. Methods Hindlimb unloading treatment A total of 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats (Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, China), aged eight weeks and sourced, were randomly allocated to either the hindlimb unloading (HU,  n  = 6) or the control group (Con,  n  = 6). The tail suspension technique, a well-established model for simulating microgravity conditions, was employed and has been comprehensively detailed in our previous work [ 6 ]. The detailed steps are shown in supplementary methods. Artery dissociation The rats were initially anesthetized using carbon dioxide according to AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2020). Subsequently, they were euthanized through exsanguination, facilitated by a transcardial perfusion with 50 mL of PBS. After the removal of surrounding perivascular adipose and connective tissues, the CA and FA were pooled from 6 rats in each group (Con and HU). As described before [ 7 ], the isolated arteries were then sectioned into smaller pieces. These sections were subjected to enzymatic digestion using 2 mg/mL of collagenase I (17018-029, Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and 2 mg/mL of dispase II (D4693, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) in Hank’s balanced salt solution, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The enzymatic digestion process was halted by adding PBS supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by vigorous pipetting for 5 to 10 times to ensure thorough mixing. The resulting cell suspension was then filtered through a 30 μm cell strainer and subsequently centrifuged. ScRNA-seq of CA and FA cells Cells were enumerated using a cell counter and then adjusted to an optimal concentration, ensuring no less than 1000 cells per microliter. Subsequently, the cell suspension was prepared for single-cell sequencing on the 10× Genomics GemCode platform. The cells were combined with enzymes and bonded to Gel Beads, each impregnated with unique barcode information. This mixture was then processed through the 10× Genomics instrument, which encapsulated the cells within oil surfactant droplets to form single-cell GEM. Following this, primers were released and thoroughly mixed with the cell lysates upon the dissolution of the Gel Beads. This facilitated the reverse transcription of barcoded, full-length cDNA. PCR amplification was performed using cDNA as template for library construction. Finally, the libraries were sequenced utilizing the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits, version 3.1. The quality control, normalizing and dimentional reduction are shown in supplementary methods. Clustering, cell type annotation and subclustering of scRNA-seq data The graph-based clustering and the optimal cluster resolution were performed according to previously identified PCs. For visual representation, t-SNE was employed, utilizing the same set of PCs to encapsulate the data’s high-dimensional structure. Cluster identity was assigned by applying the Single R package according to classic cell type markers. Detailed methods are shown in Supplementary methods. For subclustering of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, gene expression data were processed with log-normalization, gene filtration, PCA, clustering, t-SNE. To identify subcluster-specific markers, the FindAllMarkers function from Seurat was utilized, providing a comprehensive set of differentially expressed genes that could distinguish each subcluster. Functional enrichment analysis Differentially expressed genes in specific cell types, clusters and differentially expressed genes between Con and HU were used to perform GO, KEGG and GSVA functional enrichment analysis. Each significantly enriched GO-term refers to a type of ontology which belongs to molecular function, cellular component or biological process. Similarly, KEGG analysis identifies metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in differentially expressed genes. GSVA was performed using GSVA R package (version 1.26) to identify enriched pathways and cellular processes in different clusters and sub-clusters. Pseudotime trajectory analysis ECs clusters, SMCs and fibroblasts were isolated and reprocessed using Seurat. Then the R package Monocle 2 [ 8 ] (version 2.26.0) was used to convert the above Seurat subsets to a Monocle object. The pseudotime kinetics of differentially expressed genes and the heatmap were displayed using the corresponding functions in the R package. Cellular communication analysis Ligand-receptor pair analysis was conducted utilizing R package “Cellchat”. Briefly, the communication probability or interaction strength of a specific ligand-receptor pair was obtained according to the gene expression of signaling ligands, receptors and their cofactors contained in Cellchat software. Our analysis encompassed a spectrum of molecular interactions, including paracrine and autocrine signaling, ECM-receptor interactions, and direct cell-cell contact interactions. The probability of communication at the signaling pathway level was calculated according to the communication probabilities of all ligand-receptor interactions in each signaling pathway. Cell cycle analysis To perform the cell cycle analysis, the Seurat R package was utilized to assign a cell cycle score to each cell by the expression levels of cell cycle markers (15 marker genes for G1 phase, 20 marker genes for S phase, 61 marker genes for G2 phase, 64 marker genes for M phase). Cells were then assigned to G1, S, or G2/M phases based on cell cycle scores. TF analysis Analysis was performed through SCENIC software, which integrates the GENIE3 algorithm, RcisTarget, and AUCell. TFs and their targets were obtained via GENIE3 algorithm. RcisTarget was used to calculate motifs that were significantly enriched in each co-expression module. The potential direct targets of motif were then predicted. We then delineated gene regulatory networks, termed regulons, which encompass both the TFs and their associated target genes. The activity of each regulon was obtained based on normalized AUC score or AUC binary matrix via AUCell R package. Gene regulatory network was done using the cytoscape software. TF analysis in the part of pseudotime trajectory analysis was performed using FIMO tools from MEMEsuite (5.1.0). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at a 5 mm thickness using a cryomicrotome (RM2016, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and these sections were subsequently mounted onto glass microscope slides. The slides were first deparaffinized in xylene I and II (20 min each). Then xylene was eliminated in a graded series of alcohols (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%). The sections were incubated with H&E solution (G1005, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Finally, the stained images were digitized using a Pannoramic MIDI scanner (3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary). Immunofluorescent staining Sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (9036-19-5, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then blocked for 0.5 h with goat serum. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody which was diluted 1:100 in TBST overnight at 4 °C. Following antibodies were used: anti-CD31 (28083-1-AP, Proteintech, Cook County, Illinois, USA), anti-eNOS (27120-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-α-SMA (67735-1-Ig, Proteintech), anti-CD68 (28058-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-CEBPB (66649-1-Ig, Proteintech), anti-SPARC (15274-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-KLF4 (11880-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-SERPINE2 (11303-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-TXNIP (18243-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-FOSB (ab184938, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-ET-1 (DF6125, Affinity Bioscience, Melbourne, Australia), anti-PDGFRα (sc-398206, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA), anti-CXCR4 (sc-53534, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PLN (ab219626, Abcam), anti-DPT (10537-1-AP, Proteintech). After washing with PBS (three times, 5 min each), the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies Fluor488 (1:500 dilution, EK011, Zhuangzhi Biotech, Xi’an, Shaanxi, China) or Cy3 (1:500 dilution, EK022, Zhuangzhi Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Images were scanned with Pannoramic MIDI scanner (3DHISTECH). Statistical analysis Intima-media thickness of CA and FA from Con and HU rats was represented as mean ± standard error of mean. P-value < 0.05 determined by unpaired Student’s t-test was considered statistically significant. Results Construction of rat single-cell atlases by scRNA-Seq Although scRNA-seq has extensively profiled vascular changes in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, a detailed single-cell analysis of arterial adaptations in hindlimb-suspended rats remains absent. We performed a systematic scRNA-seq study on more than 22,000 cells from rat carotid and femoral arteries. These rats experienced three months of hindlimb unloading, with some serving as controls under normal gravity conditions. (Fig.  1 A). After quality control, 6742, 2983, 4487, 2463 cells were acquired in Con-CA (carotid artery in contol group), Con-FA (femoral artery in contol group), HU-CA (carotid artery in hindlimb unloading group) and HU-FA (femoral artery in hindlimb unloading group) datasets (Fig.  1 B), which correspond to the median of 2260.5, 2064, 1909 and 1825 genes per cell, respectively. The mean reads per cell were 37,089, 86,801, 62,761 and 113,861 in Con-CA, Con-FA, HU-CA and HU-FA. Individual clusters were labeled for cell type with known marker genes. In total, we identified 23 cell clusters (Fig.  1 C) that could be divided into 10 major cell types (Fig.  1 D). Integrated datasets of above four groups displayed satisfactory alignment. Known markers used to divide cell types were shown in Additional file 1: Table. S1. Vascular cell types represented in the distinct clusters included ECs (cluster 5, 7, 11, 13, 20), VSMCs (cluster 0, 3, 9, 10, 14, 15), fibroblasts (cluster 1, 2, 4, 6, 12), macrophages (cluster 8), B cells (cluster 21), T cells (cluster 18), dendritic cells (cluster 17), neutrophil (cluster 19), neuron (cluster 22), and stem cells (cluster 16). The expression of marker genes across the 10 cell clusters were shown in Additional file 1: Fig.  S1 . We then examined the distribution of major cell types within each group (Fig.  1 E, F, Additional file 1: Table. S2). Notably, the proportion of SMCs was elevated in the CA relative to the FA. Interestingly, a reduction in SMC fraction was observed in HU-CA and HU-FA compared to Con (Fig.  1 F). This finding contradicts prior studies suggesting that simulated weightlessness stimulates the proliferation of CA SMCs in rats [ 5 ]. Additionally, HU-CA demonstrated a higher percentage of ECs compared with Con-CA. Moreover, the HU-FA group exhibited increased percentage of immune cells—comprising B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils—compared to Con-FA. Then, we presented top 5 highest differential expression genes relative to all other cells in each cluster (Fig.  1 G). For example, the specific markers of ECs are  Mall ,  Cldn5 ,  Vwf ,  Mmrn2 ,  Gja5 .  Vwf  is the canonical ECs gene.  Cldn5 , encoding a tight junction protein, and  Mmrn2 , encoding an extracellular matrix protein known as Multimerin 2, were also highlighted. The markers of SMCs are  Acta1  and potassium channel subfamily K member 3 ( Kcnk3 ). Fibroblast marker is  Scara5 , a class A scavenger receptor with the clearance function of foreign and endogenous material [ 9 ]. Here we also showed the number of upregulated genes with average fold change > 1.28, P value < 0.05 for each cell type compared to all other cells (Fig.  1 H). Consistent with previous findings, monocytes including dendritic cells and macrophages have more differentially expressed genes than other cell clusters [ 10 ]. \n Fig. 1 Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of Con and HU CA and FA.

( H ) The number of differentially expressed genes in each cell type compared to other cell types \n Artery-specific differentially expressed genes between con and HU group in ECs and distinct gene expression profiles for EC sub-clusters Currently, there’s no report on gene expression differences in SMCs, ECs, fibroblasts, and immune cells from carotid and femoral arteries under microgravity, mainly because isolating these cell types is difficult. After sequencing of flow-sorted vascular cells, datasets from different cell types were aggregated in this study. We first focused on the differentially expressed genes in ECs between Con and HU (Fig.  2 A, B). For ECM remodeling, genes encoding collagen such as  col4a1 ,  col4a2  were downregulated in both HU-CA and HU-FA. For secretory function of ECs, the increase of  Vcam1  and  Nos3  suggested enhanced vasodilatation and adhesion of leukocytes in HU-CA ECs. Downregulation of  Edn1  which encodes ET-1 may give rise to decreased vasoconstriction and basal vascular tone in HU-CA. The protein levels of eNOS (Fig.  2 C), which was coded by  Nos3 , and ET-1 (Fig.  2 D) were verified by immunofluorescence.  Mmrn1  and  Vwf  were increased in HU-CA, promoting platelet adhesion and clotting [ 11 ].  Ccn1 , essential for atherogenesis, was reported to be induced by oscillatory shear stress and inhibited by laminar shear stress [ 12 ]. It was upregulated in HU-FA but downregulated in HU-CA, highlighting the differential shear stress impacts on the CA and FA. KEGG pathway analysis revealed an upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, such as  Rpl37 ,  Rpl36 ,  Rpl35 , in ECs from both HU-CA and HU-FA when compared to their Con counterparts (Fig.  2 E, F). Sub-clustering analysis of ECs revealed 6 sub-clusters. Sub-cluster 0 showed high expression of  Isl1  (Fig.  2 G), a marker of embryonic stem cell-derived progenitors [ 13 ], indicating the potential of self-renewal. The sub-cluster also featured increased expression of  Bmp6 , a gene implicated in osteogenic differentiation of ECs during vascular calcification [ 14 ]. This sub-cluster showed enrichment for KEGG terms related to protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.  2 H), which was confirmed by GSVA analysis result that sub-cluster 0 was involved in protein secretion and unfolded protein response (Fig.  2 I). Compared to FA, more ECs from CA were in sub-cluster 0 (Fig.  2 J). Contrary to sub-cluster 0, sub-cluster 1 demonstrated a more enrichment of cell number in FA (Fig.  2 H).  Lipe  and  Gpihbp1 , involved in lipolytic process [ 15 ], were two markers for sub-cluster 1. Sub-cluster 1 specifically exhibited enrichment for the “Rap1 signaling pathway” and its downstream “PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway” (Fig.  2 K), which are known to play roles in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Consistent with this,  Cxcl12 , another marker of sub-cluster 1, is recognized for its involvement in endothelial migration [ 16 ]. For EC sub-cluster 2, marker genes  Rpl30  and  Rps25  were crucial for ribosome assembly and protein translation. Consistently, GO enrichment analysis indicated significant enrichment for the terms “Translation” and “Structural constituent of ribosome” in EC sub-cluster 2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). The EC sub-cluster 3 expressed  Lyve1 , a lymphatic endothelial marker, suggesting this population was lymphatic endothelium. The definition of sub-cluster 3 was further confirmed by the elevated expression of  Ccl21 , a chemokine produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. Notably, there were more lymphatic endothelial cells in FA than that in CA (Fig.  2 J).  Cnn1 , a canonical marker of SMCs and a late indicator of EndoMT, is a hallmark of EC sub-cluster 4 [ 17 ]. EndoMT is a process whereby endothelial cells undergo phenotype changes towards to mesenchymal cells such as SMCs and fibroblasts. EndoMT is integral to the pathogenesis of conditions such as hypertension-induced vascular injury [ 18 ] and atherosclerosis [ 19 ]. The sub-cluster 4 also expresses the myogenic marker  Acta2  which encodes α-SMA and  Pln  which encodes phospholamban, a regulator of ER Ca 2+  homeostasis in angiogenesis [ 20 ], suggesting a mesenchymal cell phenotype possibly due to EndoMT. To further confirm EndoMT, we compared the differential expression of endothelial cell markers and mesenchymal cell markers between the HU group and the Con group. The dot plot showed that the expression of Tie1, Cdh5, and Vwf was downregulated, whereas the expression of S100a4, Vimentin and smooth muscle cell markers Acta2, Spp1 and Cnn1 was upregulated in EC sub-cluster 4 of HU-CA in comparison with Con counterpart (",

  "discussion": "Discussion Weightless environment has a wide range of physiological effects on blood vessels. Here, we present a comprehensive CA and FA cell atlas in rats subjected to hindlimb suspension by utilizing scRNA-seq. We observed hindlimb unloading-associated alterations in cell type composition. Cell type-specific and artery type-specific transcriptomic changes were presented. The heterogeneous sub-clusters of the major cell types were then identified. In addition, cellular communication and TF prediction in FA and CA of rats under hindlimb unweighting was described. Our study will collectively provide insights into the mechanisms underlying arterial remodeling in microgravity conditions. The most frequently reported duration for rat tail suspension is 28 days. However, as human spaceflight missions become increasingly prolonged, it is imperative to observe the physiological effects of long-term weightlessness on biological organisms. Consequently, we have extended the duration of rat tail suspension to three months. Using scRNA-sequencing method, we delineated 23 distinct cell clusters, representing the predominant cell types within the CA and FA. A comparative analysis between the HU and Con groups revealed a notable decrease in the proportion of SMCs in both the CA and FA after tail suspension. This observation contradicts earlier studies [ 5 ], possibly due to variations in the duration of hindlimb suspension, as vascular remodeling is an ongoing and dynamic process. Furthermore, an elevated proportion of immune cells in the HU-FA suggests heightened inflammation in the femoral arteries of rats subjected to weightlessness. Considering dysregulated genes may be highly specific for different vascular cell types, we provide transcriptomic changes of four major arterial cell types (SMCs, ECs, fibroblasts and macrophages). Notably, fibroblasts from both the CA and FA showed the most significant upregulation and downregulation of genes. This finding underscored their high plasticity and crucial role in vascular remodeling in hindlimb-unloaded rats. The adventitial fibroblast’s role in vascular remodeling is increasingly recognized [ 58 ,  59 ]. However, knowledge about vascular fibroblasts from rats exposed to hindlimb suspension is lacking. ScRNA-seq offers an opportunity to detect gene expression of vascular fibroblasts from HU-CA and HU-FA. The upregulation of  Serpine1  and  Serpine2  suggested impaired matrix degradation in CA and FA after microgravity. Additionally, the heightened expression of  Txnip  indicated the elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory state of fibroblasts in HU-CA and HU-FA. Metabolic processes in adventitial fibroblasts were also found to be altered post-hindlimb unloading in the CA and FA, emphasizing the importance of fibroblast metabolic changes in vascular remodeling. This result was consistent with a previous study that highlighted the significant role of metabolic changes in adventitial fibroblasts in the vascular r",
  "conclusion": "Conclusions Comprehensive single-cell compendium of the vascular remodeling process in rats at the molecular level under simulated microgravity is described in our study. The identification of region-specific and artery-specific transcriptomic changes, along with commonalities between the CA and FA, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the vascular remodeling process under microgravity conditions. By focusing on the less-explored fibroblasts and immune cells, as well as the sub-clusters within the major arterial cell types, our research sheds light on the intricate biological processes at play under simulated microgravity."
