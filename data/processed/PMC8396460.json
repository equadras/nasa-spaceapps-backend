Introduction Responses to spaceflight include cardiovascular deficits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed. Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body fluids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a fluid shift between the vasculature and interstitium [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]. The fluid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms [ 6 ]. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts [ 7 ]. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [ 8 ], despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceflight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceflight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [ 9 , 10 ]. A reduction in myocardial interstitial fluid may contribute to lower myocardial mass following microgravity exposure [ 11 ]. In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy [ 12 ]. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [ 13 ], although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [ 14 , 15 ], but not in others [ 13 ], thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [ 16 , 17 , 18 ]. In fact, spaceflight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Spaceflight can alter expression of various cell cycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes [ 28 , 29 ] including CDKN1A (also known as P21), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions and apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1A/P21 is a negative regulator of tissue regeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master transcriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Spaceflight elevates  Cdkn1a  expression in bone tissue [ 30 ], liver and kidney [ 31 ] as well as cultured cells [ 29 ], implicating activation of CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment. We hypothesized that spaceflight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used thematic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis ( Trp53 ) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression findings in heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including those related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, inflammation and DNA damage repair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration spaceflight. 2. Results 2.1. Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight Immediately after landing, all flight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control mice were determined to be in good condition by veterinary examination.  Figure 1  shows the schematic of the experiment design and workflow. The average weight loss of FLT mice over the duration of the experiment was 2.0 g (−9.1%, SD = 2.1 g,  p  = 0.013) whereas GRD control mice lost an average of 0.7 g (−3.4%, SD = 0.9 g,  p  = 0.096); the difference in body weight loss averages for FLT versus GRD was not significant ( p  = 0.143). FLT habitats showed an average of 10% less food remaining, and 24% less water remaining than GRD habitats. However, measured values for food and water utilization after flight may not precisely reflect actual consumption by mice due to possible differences in food breakdown and water spillage in FLT versus GRD habitats. 2.2. Spaceflight Altered Expression of Oxidative Stress Related Genes Comparable quantities (average of 38.5 μg RNA per tissue sample) and high qualities of total RNA were obtained from all the FLT and GRD samples. To determine if spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance in cardiac tissue, oxidative stress PCR array was performed on 84 genes related to oxidative metabolism ( Supplementary Table S1 ), and this data set was supplemented with real time PCR analysis of  Nfe2l2  expression levels ( Figure 2 ). Gene expression levels of FLT and GRD controls showed a trend towards upregulation of a majority of those genes which were altered by spaceflight ( Table 1 ). Out of the 84 genes on the array, 11 genes were upregulated and 3 genes were downregulated in FLT samples relative to GRD ( p  < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). Specifically, there was a marked 6.6-fold upregulation in expression of NADPH oxidase 1 ( Nox1 ), suggesting an increase in production of superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, expression of Prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 ( Ptgs2 ), which acts as peroxidase, was downregulated by 3.4-fold. The upregulation of  Nox1  and downregulation of  Ptgs2  may reflect elevated oxidative stress within heart tissue of FLT mice relative to GRD controls. In addition,  Txnip  was upregulated by 1.9-fold and  Fancc  was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT samples.  Ncf2 , which codes for a component of the NADPH oxidase complex that generates superoxide, was moderately downregulated by spaceflight (−1.5-fold). Other antioxidant genes ( Sod1 ,  Cat ,  Prdx6 ,  Gsr ,  Tpo ,  Txnrd3 ,  Slc41a3 ) and oxidative stress-responsive genes ( Xpa ,  Prnp ) were moderately affected by spaceflight (1.2-2.4 fold,  p  < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). There were no changes in the expression levels of 12 genes related to oxygen transport ( Supplementary Table S1 ). In contrast, there was a 2.4-fold reduction in expression of the global transcription factor,  Nfe2l2 , in FLT compared to GRD animals ( Figure 2 ). Thus, the expression of redox-related genes was differentially regulated as a consequence of exposure to the spaceflight environment. 2.3. Spaceflight Altered Expression of Cell Cycle/Proliferation Related Genes The expression levels of 84 genes involved cell cycle and apoptosis signal transduction were analyzed by  p53  Signaling Pathway PCR array ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Out of 84 genes, 13 genes were upregulated and 10 genes were downregulated in FLT compared to GRD controls ( Table 2 ,  p  < 0.05). Results show that genes related to cell cycle regulation were altered due to spaceflight. Specifically, cell cycle inhibitors such as  Cdkn1a  were upregulated 6.8-fold while  Cdk1  was downregulated 4.1-fold, suggesting diminished growth and proliferation signals in FLT samples compared to GRD.  Myc  was upregulated 3.9-fold ( p  < 0.05). Genes involved in inflammatory responses, including  Tnf ,  Tnfrsf10b  (Tnf receptor superfamily, member 10) and  Traf1 , were downregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease, respectively) in spaceflight samples. Out of the 14 genes analyzed for DNA damage repair, four genes were modestly upregulated ( Atr ,  Xrcc5 ,  Ercc1 ,  Apex1 ; 1.1–1.3-fold) ( Table 2 ,  p  < 0.05). There were no significant changes in apoptosis-related genes including  Trp53 ,  Bax ,  Bcl2 ,  Casp2  or  Casp9  ( Supplementary Table S2 ). 2.4. Gene Networks and Disease Predictions We made use of a computational approach to gain insight into possible protein–protein interactions among the differentially expressed genes. Analysis using String Db revealed potential interactions between the oxidative stress response and  Trp53  pathways ( Figure 3 ). A number of oxidative stress response DEGs formed a molecular interaction network including  Nox1  and  Sod1  with Catalase serving as a central node. DEGs from the  Trp53  signaling pathway also formed molecular interaction networks involving cell cycle-related genes and transcription factors. For the  Trp53  pathway,  Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdkn1a  and  Atr  served as central nodes in a molecular network that included  Chek2 ,  Fancc ,  Ercc1 ,  Xrcc5  and  Xpa1  among others. Interestingly, the oxidative stress response and  Trp53  pathways were linked by central nodes  FoxO3 ,  Jun ,  Myc , and  Hif1a , all of which code for major transcriptional regulators. This finding suggests global transcriptomic changes in the heart response to spaceflight. We also utilized a computational approach to gain insight into possible disease phenotypes associated with spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression. Functional enrichment analysis of oxidative stress array DEGs using Toppfun revealed enrichment of genes linked to hypertensive disease, atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular accident and decompensation ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Using a similar analysis approach,  p53  array DEGs revealed potential links to a number of cancers including sarcoma, immune suppression, impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular pathologies including hypertensive disease, acute myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis ( Supplementary Table S4 ). 3. Discussion Our findings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level to the novel environment of space. Spaceflight experiments using rodents present unique practical challenges though similar benefits to rodent studies on Earth. The animals flown in space during this particular mission were deemed healthy, as assessed by veterinary examination after return to Earth, and the finding that animal body weights were comparable in FLT mice compared to GRD controls at the termination of the study. Further, numerous scientific reports from these mice describe related results obtained studying other organ systems (e.g., [ 30 , 32 , 33 ]). The RNA samples recovered from the hearts were consistent and of high quality. Therefore, we conclude that the results we obtained from this mission were valid.  Whereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of cardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited [ 12 , 13 , 34 , 35 , 36 ]. Goldstein et al. [ 12 ] report that spaceflight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes in rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac atrophy. Short duration (6 days) spaceflight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of mitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle [ 34 ]. More recently, long duration spaceflight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation-related genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly, lifetime exposure of  Drosophila  to microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dysfunction, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities [ 36 ]. Furthermore, spaceflight causes cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression profile consistent with early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle [ 37 ]. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related genes provides novel findings on how the heart responds to spaceflight at the tissue level. 3.1. Oxidative Stress-Related Gene Expression in Spaceflight Heart RT-PCR array data show that expression levels of 14 genes were significantly ( p  < 0.05) altered (11 upregulated and 3 downregulated) in FLT samples as compared to GRD controls. In addition, RT-PCR analysis for  Nfe2l2  revealed lower levels in FLT mice than GRD.  Nfe2l2  is a master transcriptional regulator for oxidative stress response genes, and is rapidly transcribed within seconds following changes in the gravity vector [ 23 ]. Other tissues also display reduced  Nfe2l2  expression levels in similar spaceflight experiments entailing tissue recovery after landing [ 38 ]. Suzuki et al. recently demonstrated that long duration spaceflight activates  Nfe2l2 -dependent oxidative stress pathways in several tissues of growing mice [ 39 ]. Furthermore,  Nfe2l2 -deficient mice are protected from spaceflight-induced oxidative stress-related genes and changes in body weight [ 39 ], and also display accelerated transition of muscle fiber type without protecting from atrophy [ 40 ]. We also found that spaceflight upregulated  Nox1  6.6-fold, the change of greatest magnitude in oxidative stress-related genes observed in our study. NOX1 belongs to the NADPH oxidase family of enzymes and functions in generating ROS in a highly regulated fashion [ 41 , 42 ]. NOX1 utilizes NADPH as an electron donor and catalyzes transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Superoxide radicals are short lived and are readily converted into hydrogen peroxide. Thus, increased expression of  Nox1  can cause an increase in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 41 , 42 ]. NADPH oxidases are major sources of ROS in the vascular system and are involved in the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and myocardial infarction [ 43 ]. Several recent studies using ground-based models to simulate weightlessness show that hindlimb unloading causes cardiac atrophy, reduces cardiomyocyte size and cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by fractional shortening [ 14 ]. Inhibition of NOX1 by apocynin (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor) reduces oxidative stress markers in the heart, and mitigates atrophy and dysfunction in hindlimb unloaded mice, suggesting that  Nox1  plays an important role in mediating cardiac responses to simulated weightlessness [ 44 ]. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that increased expression of  Nox1  during spaceflight contributes to oxidative stress and myocardial abnormalities. Oxidative stress PCR array results showed lower expression of  Ptgs2  by 3.4-fold in FLT samples compared to GRD. PTGS2, also known as Cycloxygenase 2 (COX2), is the key, inducible enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts as both a dioxygenase and as a peroxidase, converting hydrogen peroxide into water. Thus, lower  Ptgs2  expression can lead to inefficient removal of hydrogen peroxide, accumulation of ROS and oxidative damage. PTGS2 is important for the maintenance of healthy cardiac tissue. Conditional cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the  Ptgs2  gene in adult mice reduces cardiac output, decreases exercise tolerance and increases susceptibility to induced ventricular arrhythmias [ 45 ]. Furthermore, human and animal models of myocardial diseases show that  Ptgs2  expression is associated with cardiac tissue damaged by infarction, septicemia and inflammatory heart diseases [ 46 ]. In addition to inflammation, the prostaglandin pathway plays an important role in mechanical signaling. In cultured cells activated by serum, spaceflight prevents induction of  Ptgs2  expression, which is avoided by on-orbit centrifugation to replace the gravity vector, implicating sensitivity to a biomechanical mechanism for microgravity-induced activation of the prostaglandin pathway [ 47 ]. Inhibition of PTGS2 also impairs recovery of skeletal muscle and bone from hindlimb unloading [ 48 , 49 ]. Thus, regulation of the prostaglandin pathway by spaceflight via changes in  Ptgs2  expression may contribute to both oxidative stress and subsequent recovery on Earth. Txnip  was upregulated 1.9-fold and  Fancc  was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT compared to GRD, which also may contribute to a pro-oxidative milieu in the heart during spaceflight. TXNIP is a negative regulator of thioredoxins (TRXs) [ 50 ], which are potent antioxidants, and their downregulation by elevated  Txnip  expression in FLT samples may lead to increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. In cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC),  Txnip  was the most upregulated by spaceflight (33-fold) [ 51 ].  Fancc  codes for an antioxidant and its downregulation can cause sensitivity to oxidative stress-mediated damage to tissue [ 52 ]. Our results indicated moderate changes in several antioxidant genes ( Sod1 ,  Cat ,  Prdx6 ,  Gsr ,  Tpo ,  Txnrd3 ,  Slc41a3 ) and other oxidative stress-responsive genes ( Xpa ,  Prnp ) (1.2–2.4-fold,  p  < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). The observed elevated expression levels of these antioxidant genes may be due to activation of compensatory mechanisms. Although the magnitude of differences between FLT and GRD for statistically significant genes were generally modest, together, the findings suggest that spaceflight activates a network of genes responsible for redox signaling and defense against oxidative stress in the heart.  3.2. Cell Cycle and Senescence-Related Gene Expression in Spaceflight Heart Increased generation of ROS during spaceflight can lead to protein, lipid and DNA damage in tissue and, as is the case with skeletal muscle, may contribute to dysfunction caused by gravitational unloading. ROS are also involved in vital cell signaling pathways such as cell-cycle progression, differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis. Cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is regulated at various checkpoints by the action of specific cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). The activities of these CDKs are controlled by the positive regulation from cyclins and negative regulation from cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Hence, expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, inflammation, DNA damage repair and apoptosis were further analyzed in hearts by  p53  Signaling PCR array. The  p53  Signaling PCR array includes 24 genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Results indicate that nine of these genes were significantly altered in FLT samples. We found spaceflight increased  Cdkn1a /p21 expression 6.8-fold in hearts compared to GRD, consistent with reports for other tissues including liver, kidney, bone and muscle [ 27 , 30 , 31 ].  CDKN1A  (also known as P21), is a potent CDK inhibitor and inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by inhibiting the activity of CDK2 or CDK4. Increases in  p21  levels in bone from mice in this spaceflight experiment spaceflight were previously associated with proliferative arrest in cultured osteoprogenitors [ 30 ]. However, the adult mammalian heart itself has limited regenerative ability. Adult  p21  levels in adult heart are thought to contribute to normal cell cycle arrest in differentiated cardiomyocytes, and there is evidence that cardiomyocytes can divide in the adult human heart [ 53 ], though it is unlikely that such a small sub-population (1.3% of total) [ 53 ] can account f",

Introduction Responses to spaceflight include cardiovascular deficits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed. Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body fluids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a fluid shift between the vasculature and interstitium [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]. The fluid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms [ 6 ]. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts [ 7 ]. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [ 8 ], despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceflight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceflight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [ 9 , 10 ]. A reduction in myocardial interstitial fluid may contribute to lower myocardial mass following microgravity exposure [ 11 ]. In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy [ 12 ]. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [ 13 ], although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [ 14 , 15 ], but not in others [ 13 ], thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [ 16 , 17 , 18 ]. In fact, spaceflight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood.

Ethics Statement All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines described by the National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by all relevant committees, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center. The IACUC approval number associated with this animal study was NAS-10-002-Y1. 4.2. Animals and Spaceflight The mice in this study were flown on the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission for the experiment “Mouse Antigen-Specific CD4+ T Cell Priming and Memory Response during Spaceflight”. The heart tissue used in this experiment was an award to E. Almeida as part of the NASA STS-131 Mouse Immunology I Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Female C57BL/6J mice were acclimatized to spaceflight food bars and lixits, but were not placed in Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats until just before spaceflight. Mice were divided into two groups: flight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control. The NASA AEM units are composed of a stainless-steel grid cage, fan blowers, a layered filter system, interior lamps, specialized food bars, and a water box. The AEM units are self-contained habitats that provide group housing with constant ad libitum access to food and water while also providing a waste management system that isolates the animals from their waste. FLT mice were launched at 14 weeks of age then flown in space for 15 days and were not subjected to any experimental procedures during spaceflight. Synchronous GRD control mice were also housed in AEMs, maintained in an orbital environmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center, and exposed to environmental conditions matched closely to those of FLT mice on the shuttle (temperature, light/dark cycle, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels). FLT and GRD control animals were weighed before flight and immediately after return and were subjected to veterinary examination prior to euthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group were measured upon recovery. Animals were euthanized at 16 weeks of age starting approximately 3 h after landing using isoflurane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Euthanasia and dissections proceeded at a pace of one mouse every 15–20 min. The heart was removed and major veins and feed arteries trimmed off. The hearts of four mice per group were bisected into the cephalic and caudal regions, and the caudal halves (ventricles) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis of gene expression (the remaining hearts from four mice per group were distributed to another BSP investigator). The frozen samples were transported on dry ice to NASA Ames Research Center and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. 4.3.

Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight Immediately after landing, all flight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control mice were determined to be in good condition by veterinary examination.  Figure 1  shows the schematic of the experiment design and workflow. The average weight loss of FLT mice over the duration of the experiment was 2.0 g (−9.1%, SD = 2.1 g,  p  = 0.013) whereas GRD control mice lost an average of 0.7 g (−3.4%, SD = 0.9 g,  p  = 0.096); the difference in body weight loss averages for FLT versus GRD was not significant ( p  = 0.143). FLT habitats showed an average of 10% less food remaining, and 24% less water remaining than GRD habitats. However, measured values for food and water utilization after flight may not precisely reflect actual consumption by mice due to possible differences in food breakdown and water spillage in FLT versus GRD habitats. 2.2. Spaceflight Altered Expression of Oxidative Stress Related Genes Comparable quantities (average of 38.5 μg RNA per tissue sample) and high qualities of total RNA were obtained from all the FLT and GRD samples. To determine if spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance in cardiac tissue, oxidative stress PCR array was performed on 84 genes related to oxidative metabolism ( Supplementary Table S1 ), and this data set was supplemented with real time PCR analysis of  Nfe2l2  expression levels ( Figure 2 ). Gene expression levels of FLT and GRD controls showed a trend towards upregulation of a majority of those genes which were altered by spaceflight ( Table 1 ). Out of the 84 genes on the array, 11 genes were upregulated and 3 genes were downregulated in FLT samples relative to GRD ( p  < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). Specifically, there was a marked 6.6-fold upregulation in expression of NADPH oxidase 1 ( Nox1 ), suggesting an increase in production of superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, expression of Prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 ( Ptgs2 ), which acts as peroxidase, was downregulated by 3.4-fold. The upregulation of  Nox1  and downregulation of  Ptgs2  may reflect elevated oxidative stress within heart tissue of FLT mice relative to GRD controls. In addition,  Txnip  was upregulated by 1.9-fold and  Fancc  was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT samples.  Ncf2 , which codes for a component of the NADPH oxidase complex that generates superoxide, was moderately downregulated by spaceflight (−1.5-fold). Other antioxidant genes ( Sod1 ,  Cat ,  Prdx6 ,  Gsr ,  Tpo ,  Txnrd3 ,  Slc41a3 ) and oxidative stress-responsive genes ( Xpa ,  Prnp ) were moderately affected by spaceflight (1.2-2.4 fold,  p  < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). There were no changes in the expression levels of 12 genes related to oxygen transport ( Supplementary Table S1 ). In contrast, there was a 2.4-fold reduction in expression of the global transcription factor,  Nfe2l2 , in FLT compared to GRD animals ( Figure 2 ). Thus, the expression of redox-related genes was differentially regulated as a consequence of exposure to the spaceflight environment. 2.3. Spaceflight Altered Expression of Cell Cycle/Proliferation Related Genes The expression levels of 84 genes involved cell cycle and apoptosis signal transduction were analyzed by  p53  Signaling Pathway PCR array ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Out of 84 genes, 13 genes were upregulated and 10 genes were downregulated in FLT compared to GRD controls ( Table 2 ,  p  < 0.05). Results show that genes related to cell cycle regulation were altered due to spaceflight. Specifically, cell cycle inhibitors such as  Cdkn1a  were upregulated 6.8-fold while  Cdk1  was downregulated 4.1-fold, suggesting diminished growth and proliferation signals in FLT samples compared to GRD.  Myc  was upregulated 3.9-fold ( p  < 0.05). Genes involved in inflammatory responses, including  Tnf ,  Tnfrsf10b  (Tnf receptor superfamily, member 10) and  Traf1 , were downregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease, respectively) in spaceflight samples.

Conclusions In conclusion, our study revealed that spaceflight significantly altered cardiac expression of genes related to cell cycle/growth (notably  Cdkn1a / p21, Cdk1,  and  Myc ), inflammation (notably  Tnf ) and oxidative stress (notably  Nfe2l2 ,  Nox1, Ptgs2 ), which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. These findings provide novel data suitable for developing testable hypotheses for further study. Identification of specific mechanisms and molecules responsible for excess ROS generation during spaceflight is of considerable interest, and may yield new therapeutic approaches."
