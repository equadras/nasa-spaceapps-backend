  "abstract": "N 6 -threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the  Drosophila  ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1.  kae1  hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of  Drosophila  Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent  kae1  melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand,  kae1  mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of  kae1 , whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong  kae1  alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.",

  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION Beyond the four canonical ribonucleosides present in RNA, nearly all life forms bear an array of modified bases in various transcript populations. Over 100 chemical modifications have been documented, with dozens often present in individual species; the majority of distinct modified ribonucleosides occur on tRNA ( Machnicka et al. 2013 ). Altogether, RNA modifications collectively play diverse roles in RNA quality control, secondary structure, transcript stability, translational efficiency, translational fidelity, and regulation of RNA–protein interactions ( Gu et al. 2014 ;  Hopper and Huang 2015 ) and can influence disease and cancer progression ( Grewal 2015 ;  Kirchner and Ignatova 2015 ). While many post-transcriptional modifications of RNA are broadly conserved, only a few are universal across known life forms. One prominent example is  N 6 -threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A), which is found at high frequency at position 37 of tRNAs that decode ANN codons ( Grosjean et al. 1995 ). This modification was recognized decades ago, and it stabilizes cognate codon–anticodon interactions through a stacking interaction that stabilizes the weak interaction with the first codon base, which comprises a weak A–U pair ( Weissenbach and Grosjean 1981 ;  Yarian et al. 2002 ;  Agris 2008 ). However, the enzymes that generate this modification remained elusive until relatively recently. Based on the inference that all organisms harbor t6A-modified tRNAs ( Sprinzl and Vassilenko 2005 ), bioinformatic isolation of universally conserved genes of unknown function ( Galperin and Koonin 2004 ) yielded a short list of candidate genes that first led to the identification of YrdC/Sua5 as a t6A pathway component ( El Yacoubi et al. 2009 ). Subsequently, members of the universal gene family Kae1/Qri7/YgjD were recognized to be essential for t6A biosynthesis, along with its partner proteins (in yeast) Pcc1 and Bud32 ( El Yacoubi et al. 2011 ;  Srinivasan et al. 2011 ). Of note, mutations in components of the Kae1, Pcc1, Bud32, and Cgi121 complex (collectively termed KEOPS) had been isolated some years earlier, via divergent approaches intended at identifying factors in telomere maintenance ( Downey et al. 2006 ) and splicing/transcription ( Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006 ). At the time, the molecular role of the KEOPS complex was obscure, but its deep conservation justified solving the atomic structures of the archaeal Kae1/Bud32 natural fusion protein ( Hecker et al. 2008 ) and the entire eukaryotic KEOPS complex ( Mao et al. 2008 ). These studies assigned Kae1 as an ASKHA-type ATPase, Bud32 as a kinase, and Pcc1 as a dimerization subunit, with Kae1 physically interacting with both Bud32 and Pcc1. Only later, with the recognition that these genes are involved in t6A accumulation, did efforts become possible to reconstitute the biosynthesis of t6A-modified tRNA in vitro, using purified bacterial YrdC (Sua5) and YgjD (Kae1) and two bacterial-specific genes that cluster with YgjD, namely YjeE and YeaZ ( Deutsch et al. 2012 ). Similarly, yeast Sua5 and KEOPS complex sufficed to generate t6A-modified tRNA in vitro ( Perrochia et al. 2013 ). The proposed mechanism is that Sua5 converts bicarbonate and threonine via a series of intermediates into threonylcarbamoyladenylate, which is transferred to the active site of Kae1 within the KEOPS complex to modify tRNA position A37. Notably, Kae1 is the only truly universally conserved component of KEOPS ( Galperin and Koonin 2004 ), and eukaryotes contain a paralog of Kae1 termed Qri7 that is mitochondrially localized ( Huh et al. 2003 ). The fact that no other KEOPS components localize to mitochondria led to a suspicion that Qri7 represents a primal core factor that does not require additional presumably accessory KEOPS components. Indeed, subcellular redirection of Qri7 to the cytoplasm rescued the slow growth phenotypes of all KEOPS members that are defective for t6A accumulation ( Wan et al. 2013 ). Moreover, in vitro synthesis of t6A-modified tRNA was reconstituted solely with purified Sua5, Qri7, and substrate tRNA, in the presence of threonine, bicarbonate, and ATP ( Wan et al. 2013 ). Thus, Kae1/Qri7 is the central downstream enzyme in the generation of t6A-modified tRNA. The assignment of core genes in the t6A pathway permits organismal phenotypes to be correlated with the absence of these modified tRNAs. Budding yeast t6A pathway mutants ( El Yacoubi et al. 2009 ,  2011 ;  Srinivasan et al. 2011 ) are very slow-growing, while the bacterial pathway (e.g., in  Bacillus subtilis  and  Escherichia coli ) is essential for viability and cell morphology ( Arigoni et al. 1998 ;  Handford et al. 2009 ). These seemingly general defects befit loss of a fundamental RNA modification pathway, but do not lend insight into particular processes. Otherwise, mutants of KEOPS complex members in single-celled organisms have impact on telomere maintenance ( Downey et al. 2006 ), transcription ( Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006 ), and genome stability ( Oberto et al. 2009 ), although it remains unclear how directly the loss of t6A relates to these phenotypes. However, certain phenotypes now seem to be directly related to the biochemical function of t6A in improving translational fidelity. Of note, yeast  sua5  was originally isolated as a suppressor of  cyc1  alleles harboring an aberrant upstream start codon (uORF) ( Hampsey et al. 1991 ;  Na et al. 1992 ), implicating Sua5 in start site selection; AUG is indeed recognized by a t6A-modified tRNA. Correspondingly, Sua5 affects various aspects of normal translation, as mutants exhibit increased leaky scanning through AUG, frameshifting, and nonsense suppression ( Lin et al. 2010 ). One prominent locus controlled via endogenous uORFs is the amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factor GCN4 ( Hinnebusch 2005 ). Indeed, not only does  sua5  derepress  GCN4 , KEOPS mutants ( kae1  and  pcc1 ) induce a gene expression signature that is substantially enriched for Gcn4 targets ( Daugeron et al. 2011 ). These precedents suggest that it may be possible to make linkages between altered translation and organismal phenotypes, even for this “housekeeping” cellular activity. To date, genetic analysis of t6A pathway components has mostly been limited to single cell organisms, such as microbes and yeast. One study on the  Drosophila melanogaster  Bud32/PRPK homolog utilized RNAi-mediated knockdowns to define growth related defects upon  bud32  depletion, although biochemical evidence was not presented for an impact on t6A biogenesis in this condition ( Ibar et al. 2013 ). Interestingly, the growth defects were related to PI3K/TOR signaling, and could be partially restored by expression of activated S6-kinase ( Ibar et al. 2013 ). In this study, we describe the isolation of a large allelic series of  D. melanogaster kae1  mutants, ranging from weak hypomorphs, strong mutants, to null alleles. These present various growth-related defects, developmental delay, and melanotic tumors. We present extensive biochemical and genetic evidence that  Drosophila kae1  and its partners are core factors in t6A biogenesis. Notably, our phenotypic analysis reveals substantial differences in the genetic requirements for t6A in proliferating versus nonproliferating tissues. In particular, analysis of mitotic tissues in full knockout and in clonal settings indicates an essential requirement for  kae1 , whereas various nonproliferating tissues can be maintained in the null state for weeks. Moreover,  kae1  appears to act as a tumor suppressor in the larval hematopoietic tissue. These data highlight biological complexity in the requirements of a general regulatory factor, and the utility of the  Drosophila  model to further understand the roles of t6A modification during animal development and disease. RESULTS Isolation of the “ Black Spot ” complementation group During efforts to isolate mutants in the 72D-F region, we conducted an F2 EMS mutagenesis screen against  Df(3L)ED220 , which deletes 324,210 bp of chromosome 3L:16,080,584–16,404,777 (see Materials and Methods). We screened ∼7000 crosses of animals bearing mutagenized chromosomes to this deficiency, and recovered 64 lethals. Within this collection, we recognized numerous alleles for which hemizygous larvae bore characteristic melanotic masses, which we colloquially termed “ Black Spot ” mutants ( Fig. 1 A). These mutants failed to complement each other, and they typically exhibited an extended larval period prior to lethality ( Fig. 1 B–D; Supplemental Fig. 1). Notably, while  Drosophila  larvae complete their larval stages around day 5 and commence pupation, some  Black Spot  mutants survive as larvae for up to 18 d. Systematic tests against all of the lethal alleles we obtained in this genomic interval revealed additional noncomplementing mutations. Many of these mutants lacked black spots or generated them with low frequency ( Fig. 1 B–D). Several of these alleles were able to develop to pupal stages or even into pharate adults as hemizygotes, suggesting they might represent hypomorphs. Overall, these eight alleles appear to represent an extensive allelic series. FIGURE 1. Isolation and characterization of  Black Spot  mutants. ( A ) Exemplar of the  Black Spot  phenotype.  [1A13] / Df(3L)ED220  larvae exhibit melanotic nodules of various sizes; a particularly large one is labeled with an arrowhead (“BS”). ( B – D ) Complementation tests identified a collection of  Black Spot  mutants, only some of which actually generate melanotic masses with high penetrance (examples labeled with arrowheads). Normal (wt) animals complete their third instar larval stage by day ∼5, and proceed to ∼5 d of pupal development. Pupae containing pharate animals are visible by day ∼10, and they eclose shortly thereafter as adult flies. Wt animals are shown as a reference to the  left  of  B  and  C . In contrast, many hemizygous  Black Spot  alleles are substantially developmentally delayed and maintain their larval phase until days 12 ( C ) to 16 ( D ), with some living mutants detected at day 18 (not shown). All of the larvae collected in this summary were mobile and thus alive. Hypomorphic mutants could pupate and even advance to the pharate stage; however, it is likely that some of the pupae shown at the latest days are deceased. See Supplemental Figure 1 for additional notes regarding the larval extended phase, lethal phase, and black spot penetrance at different ages in the different hemizygous mutants. ( E ) Several of the  Black Spot  mutants attain larger larval size than normal; shown are  [1A13]  hemizygotes as an example. Other alleles such as  [f10978]  are growth deficient. All alleles tested could be rescued by  kae1  genomic transgenes; shown is rescue of  [f10978]/Df  larva. Black Spot  mutants affect the  Drosophila  ortholog of Kae1 To identify the gene mutated in  Black Spot  mutants, we used  P -element mapping ( Zhai et al. 2003 ) to narrow the region of interest within the deficiency (Supplemental Fig. 2). Coding exons from genes in the region were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from hemizygous mutant larvae and sequenced. We identified one locus ( CG4933 ), the fly ortholog of  Kae1 , that harbored nonconservative changes in all eight alleles ( Fig. 2 A). Subsequently, we identified two uncharacterized mutants in 72F-73A ( l(3)72Fb[209]  and  l(3)72Fb[331] , V Bedian, pers. comm. to FlyBase) that failed to complement  Black Spot  mutants. Sequencing showed that the  l(3)72Fb  alleles exhibit missense and nonsense mutations in  CG4933 , respectively. Notably, while  l(3)72Fb[209]  mutates a residue in the ATP-binding pocket, none of the other point mutations directly affect any functionally characterized regions (e.g., other residues that bind ATP or metal ion, or Kae1 faces that bind its partner KEOPS proteins Pcc1 or Bud32,  Fig. 2 A). Finally, we found that  PBac{WH}CG4933[f01978] , which carries a piggyBac insertion into the  CG4933  5′ UTR ( dos Santos et al. 2015 ), also failed to complement  Black Spot  mutants. These observations strongly support that  CG4933  corresponds to  Black Spot . Consistent with this, qRT-PCR analysis of several independent point mutants showed moderate decreases in  CG4933  transcripts, and these were undetectable in  f01978  hemizygotes ( Fig. 2 B,C). FIGURE 2. Summary of  Drosophila kae1 (CG4933)  mutant alleles. ( A ) An alignment of fruit fly, human, yeast, and archaeal orthologs of Kae1. Functionally/structurally defined regions are highlighted, including the binding regions for Pcc1 and Bud32, and the ATP- and ion-binding regions. All  Black Spot  alleles recovered from our screen revealed that point mutations affected well-conserved residues. Notably, none of the mutations directly affects a known functional site, although a few mutations are in the vicinity of such regions. The noncomplementing allele  l(3)72Fb[331] , identified from a public stock collection, bears a nonsense mutation in  kae1 . Note that 1A2 and 1A19 induce the same coding change, even though these were isolated from different chromosomes in the screen. ( B ) qRT-PCR analysis of  kae1  from various homozygous or hemizygous mutants. All of our point alleles maintain substantial levels of kae1 transcripts, although several of them are reduced by 20%–30%. The pBac insertion into the 5′ UTR of  kae1 ,  f[10978] , appears to be a null allele as no transcript was detected. ( C ) Agarose gel analysis of qRT-PCR amplicons confirms the absence of  kae1  transcripts in  f[10978]/Df  larvae. To confirm that  Black Spot  phenotypes were functionally due to loss of  CG4933 , we generated untagged and GFP-tagged genomic transgenes using the  P[acman]  backbone. Both CG4933 constructs rescued independent lethal hemizygotes ( 1A13  and  f01978 ) to adult viability, and no melanotic masses were observed in rescued animals (e.g.,  Figs. 1 E,  3  and other data not shown). In summary, we have isolated metazoan mutants of  kae1 , encoding a universal tRNA modification factor, representing the first extensive allelic series of a t6A pathway factor in any organism. FIGURE 3. Analysis of t6A-modified tRNAs in yeast KEOPS and  Drosophila kae1  mutants. ( A ) Analysis of yeast t6A pathway mutants is shown as a control. Primer extension assays yield a ladder of bands indicating the presence of stalled products. These include a band at position A37 of tRNA-Ile[AAU] of wild-type yeast that is strongly depleted in yeast t6A pathway mutants, thus indicating a t6A-modified nucleoside. tRNA-Val[UAC] is shown as a control for a non-t6A-bearing substrate. The ladder positions are inaccurate due to incomplete digestion; therefore, sizes are labeled according to the input primer. ( B ) Analysis of  Drosophila kae1  mutants. Modifications of the A37 positions of tRNA-Met[CAU] and tRNA-Ile[AAU] are decreased although not eliminated in two strong hemizygous conditions of  kae1 . The reduction observed in  kae1[1A13]/Df  was rescued by a  P[acman]-kae1  genomic transgene (“kae1+”). Note that mutant larvae were collected at an advanced age in their extended larval period to separate them from potential maternal contributions; the normal larval period ends at ∼5 d. ( C ) LC-MS/MS analysis of total tRNAs from  Drosophila kae1  hemizygous mutant larvae. We observe a minor decrease in total t6A-modified tRNAs in the hypomorphic allele  [7A9]  and stronger decreases in the strong/null alleles  [f01978]  and  [1A13] . The levels of t6A-modified tRNAs did not decrease further in exceptionally long-lived  kae1  mutant larvae, and the loss of t6A was rescued by a  kae1  genomic transgene. Decrease, but not elimination, of t6A-modified tRNAs in  kae1  mutants Although Sua5/KEOPS genes are well-conserved across different domains of life, their involvement in t6A synthesis has not formally been demonstrated outside of unicellular models. We initially utilized primer extension assays to assess potential defects in the accumulation of t6A-modified tRNAs. As positive controls, we assayed RNAs isolated from wild-type yeast and  sua5 ,  kae1 , and  bud32  knockouts ( Srinivasan et al. 2011 ). Extensions using an end-labeled primer specific for tRNA-Ile[AAU] showed that t6A pathway mutants were specifically depleted of a stalled product at the normally modified position A37, whereas primer extension patterns for control tRNA-Val[UAC] were not substantially altered ( Fig. 3 A). Similar assays of third instar larvae bearing various strong  Drosophila kae1  alleles in  trans  to a deficiency also revealed alteration at A37 ( Fig. 3 B). However, the loss of modified tRNAs in the total population were notably modest compared to the yeast mutants, since yeast  kae1  mutants retain only a few percent of total t6A ( El Yacoubi et al. 2011 ;  Srinivasan et al. 2011 ); see also  Figure 4 . FIGURE 4. Genetic and molecular complementation of yeast t6A mutants with  Drosophila  orthologs. ( A – C ) Single complementation tests. The schematic depicts the transformations of cognate yeast genes and their fly orthologs, assayed for complementation of  sua5  ( A ),  kae1  ( B ), and  bud32  ( C ) null mutants. Comparison of single colony sizes indicates substantial growth rescue by fly proteins, although not as robust as the yeast counterparts. ( D,E ) Double complementation tests. The schematics depict combinations of fly orthologs assayed for complementation of  kae1  ( D ) and  bud32  ( E ) null mutants. Improved growth rescue by supplying combinations of fly factors was noticeable, particularly for  Drosophila kae1 + bud32 . ( F ) Primer extension analysis demonstrating molecular rescue of t6A-modified tRNA-Ile by yeast and fly factors. ( G ) Mass spectrometry analysis of total yeast tRNAs.  kae1  mutant yeast has borderline detectable levels of t6A-modified tRNAs, which are restored by complementation with yeast  KAE1  and by  Drosophila  KEOPS genes. Consistent with the behavior in yeast growth ( D ) and in primer extension assays ( F ), the combination of  Drosophila kae1 + bud32  conferred the best rescue of t6A-modified tRNAs. Inspection of modENCODE data ( Brown et al. 2014 ) shows that  Drosophila kae1  is ubiquitously expressed but present at highest levels in ovaries and the early blastoderm embryo, indicating its strong maternal deposition. Some maternal gene products can support organismal processes for days ( Lecourtois and Schweisguth 1995 ;  Lu et al. 2000 ), and tRNAs themselves are typically expected to be relatively stable ( Hanoune and Agarwal 1970 ), although loss of some tRNA modifications is documented to render tRNAs unstable ( Alexandrov et al. 2006 ). Because of these considerations, we sought to extend the analysis of  kae1  zygotic mutants as late as possible. Bearing in mind that normal  Drosophila  complete their larval stages by ∼5 d, we collected RNA from 12-d and 18-d  kae1  mutant larvae. However, we did not observe further decreases in the level of t6A-modified tRNAs even at these extended timepoints ( Fig. 3 ). To provide a global assessment on the amount of t6A-modified tRNAs in  kae1  mutants, we purified total tRNA, enzymatically hydrolyzed the tRNA to ribonucleosides, and analyzed these using liquid chromatography-coupled triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a dynamic MRM method ( Su et al. 2014 ). This analysis showed a mild (∼10%) decrease of t6A-modified tRNAs in hemizygotes of the weak allele  kae1[7A9] , and more substantial decreases (∼40%) in hemizygotes of the strong/null alleles  kae1[1A13]  and  kae1[f01978]  ( Fig. 3 C). We also observed full restoration of t6A-modified tRNAs in LC-MS/MS analysis of  P[acman]-CG4933/+; kae1[1A13]/Df  larvae, consistent with the viability rescue conferred by the genomic transgene. Together, these observations provide evidence that  kae1  is required for normal accumulation t6A-modif",

  "discussion": "DISCUSSION Confirmation of the t6A modification pathway in a metazoan To date, nearly all studies of the t6A biogenesis pathway have been conducted in unicellular organisms such as bacteria or yeast. The first functional study of a metazoan t6A component involved knockdown of the mitochondrial Kae1 paralog Qri7 (OSGEP-L) in  Caenorhabditis elegans , which induced defective mitochondrial morphology and function ( Oberto et al. 2009 ). Subsequently, a knockdown study of the  D. melanogaster  Bud32/PRPK reported growth defects relating to defective TOR signaling ( Ibar et al. 2013 ). However, neither study assessed biochemical defects in t6A accumulation per se. Furthermore, knockdown approaches do not generally achieve genetic null states. We demonstrate loss of t6A-modified tRNAs in  Drosophila kae1  mutants, using both primer extension of individual species and mass spectrometry to examine the bulk population. Moreover, we demonstrate substantial cross-species rescue by fly Kae1 (and its partners) in yeast  kae1  mutants, both in terms of growth capacity and in recovery of t6A-modified tRNAs. While this work was in preparation, similar observations using the  kae1  transposon insertion alleles were reported by the Glavic group ( Rojas-Benitez et al. 2015 ). Our findings corroborate and extend their results. Nevertheless, our detection of substantial t6A-modified tRNAs in  Drosophila kae1  mutants was unexpected. Previous characterization of yeast  kae1  mutants ( El Yacoubi et al. 2011 ;  Srinivasan et al. 2011 ), which we confirm here, showed nearly complete absence of t6A-modified tRNAs. This raises two general possibilities. First, it may be that t6A-modified tRNAs are exceptionally stable in  Drosophila . In this scenario, even though we assayed timepoints going well past the established range of maternal effects (e.g., up to 18 d, or the equivalent of a week-old adult fly), those modified tRNAs that were maternally deposited or generated from maternal  kae1  mRNA and/or protein persisted all that time. Alternatively, many species, including yeast and  Drosophila , express a mitochondrial Kae1 paralog named Qri7. Although mitochondrially derived t6A appears to comprise a minute portion of the total pool in single-celled organisms, the situation might be different in a metazoan. For example, the substantial populations of nonproliferating tissues that tolerate deletion of  kae1  include the larval musculature, which sustain larval locomotion in mutants for weeks. Therefore, the remaining t6A-modified tRNAs in  kae1  null mutant larvae may potentially be contributed by the abundant mitochondria in muscles. In the future, characterization of a  Drosophila Qri7  ( CG14231 ) knockout would provide a useful comparison, especially to see if Qri7 loss preferentially affects tissues with exceptional needs for oxidative phosphorylation.
