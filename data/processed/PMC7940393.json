  "abstract": "Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium  Vibrio fischeri  was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from  V. fischeri  is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of  V. fischeri  defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of  V. fischeri , as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.",

Indeed, alterations in the composition of the microbiome, its secretion of bioactive metabolites, as well as the symbionts’ resultant with host systems (e.g., nervous, immune, endocrine) have been found to correlate with a variety of illnesses and disorders 2 – 4 . Understanding how mutualistic microbes adapt to stressful conditions within animal hosts, including humans, therefore, represents a crucial topic for microbiome research. One environment that presents numerous challenges to host–microbe homeostasis is spaceflight 5 . In particular, the microgravity conditions (10 −6  × g) that astronauts experience during spaceflight have been shown to disrupt the normal physiology of the human body, including the intestinal microbiome 6 , 7 . This dysbiotic response is characterized by a decline in gut bacteria predicted to be protective, including  Bifidobacterium  and  Lactobacillus  spp.; the increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens like  Escherichia coli, Enterobacteria  spp., and  Clostridia  spp.; as well as shifts in the relative proportions of dominant taxa from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes 6 – 12 . In addition to measuring the relative abundance of various bacterial populations, many studies have also sought to determine the impact of the spaceflight on the physiology of those taxa. In this regard, microgravity and microgravity-analog conditions have been found to increase the resistance of opportunistic pathogens, such as  E. coli  and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , to acid, heat, osmotic, and oxidative stresses 13 – 15 . Cultivation in these conditions is also known to promote biofilm formation and enhance the virulence of certain pathogens, including  Salmonella enterica  serovar Typhimurium 16 – 19  and  Serratia marcescens 20 . Though much progress has been made in delineating how pathogenic microbes respond to this unique stressor, the larger discussion of how beneficial microbes respond to microgravity has only recently begun to be examined 21 – 27 . One mutualistic association that has emerged as a tractable model by which to examine beneficial host–microbe interactions under modeled and natural microgravity conditions is the monospecific symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid,  Euprymna scolopes , and its bioluminescent partner  Vibrio fischeri 21 , 24 , 28 . Upon hatching,  V. fischeri  colonizes a specialized organ, known as the light organ, within the host animal and induces an irreversible remodeling of the symbiotic tissues 29 . The remodeling is marked by a pronounced apoptotic cell death event throughout the light organ’s superficial, ciliated epithelium 30 , 31 , a structure that is used to recruit symbiosis-competent  V. fischeri  from the environment and facilitate the onset of the association. Two microbe-associated molecular pattern signals (MAMPs) that have been identified as the primary mediators of the  V. fischeri -induced apoptotic event in  E. scolopes  are LPS and the peptidoglycan-derived monomer, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) 32 , 33 . These two MAMPs work synergistically to induce apoptosis and regression of the light organ’s ciliated epithelium during the onset of symbiosis 33 , 34 . Early-stage apoptosis within the host tissues, however, is primarily attributed to LPS 32 , and most of the LPS released by  V. fischeri  is embedded in outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) that are shed via rotation of the bacterium’s sheathed, polar, flagella (Fig.  1a–c ) 35 , 36 . The rapid onset of MAMP-inducible phenotypes, combined with the binary nature of the light organ symbiosis, has rendered the squid-vibrio system a uniquely informative model for the study of animal-microbial mutualisms in microgravity 22 .

Several ground-based systems exist that enable microgravity-like conditions to be modeled, including high-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs). HARVs mimic the quiescent, low-shear, fluid conditions of spaceflight when rotated around a horizontal axis (Fig.  1d ) 22 , 37 . Alternatively, rotation around a vertical axis is used to control for system-specific effects under normal Earth gravity conditions 22 , 38 . This low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment has been used to successfully mimic microgravity for decades, and has been correlated to results obtained during actual spaceflight 13 , 23 , 37 . Previous work with the squid-vibrio symbiosis using LSMMG has found that the normal symbiont-induced development of the light organ is altered by LSMMG 21 , 23 , 24 , 27 . Specifically, modeled microgravity accelerates both the onset and peak of apoptosis in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic, LPS-treated hatchlings 21 . Given the role of LPS in the normal bacteria-induced development of  E. scolopes , these findings raised the possibility that LSMMG may alter MAMP-mediated channels of host–microbe communication. MAMPs are a crucial component of both beneficial and pathogenic interactions 39 ; therefore, in this study, we examined the impact of LSMMG on the release of LPS and OMVs by  V. fischeri , and assessed the overall physiology of the symbiont when cultivated under microgravity-like conditions. Examining the effects of modeled microgravity on beneficial microbes has the potential to both provide new insight on the underlying mechanisms of microgravity-induced dysbiosis and further our understanding of mutualistic host-microbe interactions during spaceflight. Results Shedding of  V. fischeri -derived LPS increased during exponential growth under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls To determine the potential impact of modeled microgravity on LPS release during growth, cultures of wild-type  V. fischeri  ES114 were grown in HARV reactors in the LSMMG and gravity positions (Fig.  1d ) and monitored at 2–4-h intervals. The growth curves were characteristic of several microbes cultivated under LSMMG, including  V. fischeri , exhibiting increased growth rate during exponential phase compared to gravity controls (Supplementary Fig.  1 ) 23 , 27 , 40 . At each growth interval, the  V. fischeri  cells were removed from the culture media and the level of exogenous LPS shed by the bacteria was measured and compared using two independent assays. First, the colorimetric ToxinSensor Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) endotoxin assay, which measures the biological reactivity of the lipid A moiety of LPS, was used to measure reactogenic LPS in the cell-free medium filtrate. The second method, the Purpald assay, is based on the periodate oxidation of sugars of the core regions of the LPS molecule 41 , and was used on the same, cell-free media filtrate to quantify the total amount of LPS. Although complementary, these two assays target different components of the LPS molecule 42 . During exponential growth in the HARV reactors,  V. fischeri  cells released significantly more LPS under LSMMG conditions than gravity controls even after being normalized by optical density, an indicator of cell mass (Fig.  2a ). Levels of reactogenic LPS in the surrounding media, as determined by the LAL endotoxin assay, showed a pronounced increase beginning 10 h post inoculation (Fig.  2a ). The significantly higher levels of LPS released from the LSMMG-grown cells continued until ~18–20 h, after which no differences in LPS levels were observed between the two growth conditions. Measurement of total LPS by the Purpald assay showed a similar increase, with the concentrations of total LPS shedding in LSMMG cultivars compared to gravity controls higher at all tested time points between 8 and 24 h post inoculation (Fig.  2b ).

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets ( p  < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test). Increased LPS release during modeled microgravity is correlated, but not completely dependent on, cell motility Previous work has shown that most of the LPS released by  V. fischeri  is embedded in OMVs that are derived from rotation of the outer-membrane-sheathed, polar flagella 35 , 36 , 43 . This result led us to determine whether LSMMG stimulates bacterial motility, which would ostensibly increase vesiculation and, as a corollary, the shedding of LPS. Interestingly, the motility of wild-type cells grown under either LSMMG or gravity conditions showed no statistical differences when examined using direct microscopic video analysis or soft-agar motility assays (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). In addition, we also compared the amount of LPS shedding by two motility-deficient  V. fischeri  mutants,  motB1  and  flhA , grown under gravity and LSMMG conditions. Mutants defective in  motB1 , which encodes for a flagellar motor protein, do form flagella but are unable to rotate them, whereas  flhA  mutants are defective in the synthesis of flagella 44 , 45 . The motility mutants shed significantly less LPS than the wild-type  V. fischeri  ES114 under both LSMMG and gravity conditions when normalized by optical density (Fig.  3 ). In wild-type cells, concentrations of reactionogenic LPS ranged between 5 × 10 4  and 2.5 × 10 5  EU per mL of media (Fig.  2a ). In the motility mutants, however, the levels of reactogenic LPS were ~10-fold lower at each time point tested compared to the parent strain (Fig.  3a ). By 14 h, however, there was a significant difference between the level of LPS measured in the LSMMG and gravity conditions in the motility mutants. Like the wild type, LSMMG-treated mutant cells exhibited significantly higher levels of LPS in both motility mutants compared to gravity controls (Fig.  3a ). In addition, the  motB1  mutants shed significantly higher levels of LPS in the LSMMG conditions compared to the  flhA  mutant at 14, 16, and 20 h post inoculation (Fig.  3a ). These differences were also independently confirmed with the Purpald assay (Fig.  3b ) and suggest potential differences between the relative abundances between the components of the LPS molecule that are shed under LSMMG conditions. Fig. 3 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shedding of  V. fischeri  motility mutants  motB1  and  fhlA  under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) conditions compared to gravity controls. a  Reactionogenic LPS as measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate endotoxin assay under gravity (light gray) and LSMMG (dark gray) conditions.  b  Total LPS levels as measured by the Purpald assay between LSMMG and gravity (G) conditions. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets ( p  < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test). The motility mutants displayed more modest growth increases compared to the parent strain, ES114 (Supplementary Fig.  1a–c ) and to determine whether there were differences in cell size between the strains, cells collected from 12-h HARV cultures of wild type,  motB1 , and  flhA  mutants were stained with 1% crystal violet compare cell size under LSMMG and gravity treatments and observed with microscopy. Analyses of cell size revealed no significant difference between conditions or strains, suggesting optical density readings were directly comparable between LSMMG and gravity treatments for all strains (Supplementary Fig.  1d ). Higher levels of LPS in LSMMG correlate with increased OMV production To more fully understand the mechanics of increased LPS release under LSMMG conditions, the production of OMVs was examined under modeled microgravity. Almost all of the LPS released from  V. fischeri  cells has been shown to be associated with OMVs, which are produced largely due to flagellar rotation 35 , 36 . Therefore, we also examined whether OMV number and size were altered under the modeled microgravity conditions. Cultures of the wild type,  motB 1, and  flhA  strains were grown in LSMMG or gravity conditions and cell-free filtrates were evaluated at 12, 14, and 16 h post inoculation using nanoparticle tracking analysis. These times were chosen as they represent growth points with the largest discrepancies in LPS content between treatments observed across all three strains. Nanoparticle analysis revealed a positive association between symbiont OMV vesiculation and modeled microgravity conditions. Specifically, the LSMMG filtrates of wild type,  flhA , and  motB1  were found to contain significantly more OMV particles per mL than the gravity controls (Fig.  4a ). Under both conditions, OMV concentration was observed to increase over time, with both  motB1  and  flhA  generating diminished vesicular yields relative to wild-type cells (Fig.  4a ). In addition, by 14 h OMVs derived from LSMMG cultures were found to be significantly larger than gravity controls (Fig.  4b ; Supplementary Table  1 ; Supplementary Dataset  1 ). At 16 h, the average size of OMVs for the modeled microgravity cultures was 40.72 ± 0.092 nm, whereas nanoparticle size averaged only 37.10 ± 0.092 nm for gravity controls (Supplementary Table  1 ). Similarly, in the  motB1  and  flhA  motility mutants the means of OMVs from LSMMG-treated cultures were 45.35 ± 0.068 and 43.05 ± 0.065 nm, respectively, whereas the mean size of gravity-treated OMVs was 40.72 ± 0.052 ( motB1 ) and 38.16 ± 0.056 nm ( flhA ). Differences were also observed in the abundance of certain sized particles. Gravity samples tended to contain a higher proportion of smaller OMVs (diameter < 40 nm), whereas those cultivated in LSMMG exhibited a more even distribution (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). All isolated OMVs, whether they were derived from gravity or LSMMG conditions, exhibited a comparable ability to induce apoptosis and matched previously published levels of LPS and OMV-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig.  4 ) 21 , 35 .

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets ( p  < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test). V. fischeri  become increasingly sensitive to cell membrane-affecting agents in LSMMG Although motility-dependent vesiculation is characteristic of species with sheathed flagella, such as  V. fischeri 36 , all Gram-negative bacteria invariably produce OMVs by outer-membrane blebbing. OMV-blebbing is modulated by both external envelope stress and structural deficiencies in the bacterial cell wall 46 . Accordingly, the discovery that flagellar function does not, in fact, fully explain the model microgravity-associated differences observed in LPS-shedding or OMV release led us to hypothesize that LSMMG conditions may impact the integrity of the Gram-negative outer membrane. To investigate this, the susceptibility of  V. fischeri  toward a variety of cell membrane-affecting agents was compared in cells grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions, for the wild-type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h. Three specific agents were used to disrupt different components of the Gram-negative cell envelope. First, the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B was used, which binds to Gram-negative LPS and weakens the packing of lipid A molecules in the outer membrane 47 . Second, cells were exposed to the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which disrupts ionic interactions and causes bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis at high concentrations 48 . Last, cells were also exposed to a dilute solution of Triton X-100 for 1 min, which is a non-ionic detergent that disrupts lipid–lipid interactions 49 . After exposure, cell growth was assessed with optical density (Fig.  5 ; Supplementary Figs.  5  and  6 ) and plated to assess cell viability (Fig.  6 ). Fig. 5 Dose–response of  Vibrio fischeri  cell densities in the presence of polymyxin B and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Cultures of wild-type  V. fischeri  ES114 and motility mutants ( motB1  and  flhA ) were grown for 12 h under gravity (light gray) and low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) conditions. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets ( p  < 0.05; Mann–Whitney U test).

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets ( p  < 0.05; Welch’s  t -test). Dose–response curves with 1–10 μg per mL polymyxin B and 0.1–1.0% v/v SDS revealed a concentration-dependent effect on bacterial growth in both LSMMG and gravity conditions. This effect was more pronounced in the LSMMG-treated strains at all time points tested (Fig.  5 , Supplementary Figs.  5  and  6 ); LSMMG-treated  V. fischeri  generally showed increased sensitivity to membrane-disrupting agents. Despite showing different baseline sensitivities, the mutant strains also appeared more susceptible to the polymyxin B and SDS agents under LSMMG conditions compared to wild-type cells at all time points tested, with the polymyxin B treatment producing the most damaging effects to the motility mutants (Fig.  5 , Supplementary Figs.  5  and  6 ). Plating of cells treated with polymyxin B- and SDS-treated cells revealed comparable results (Fig.  6 ) indicating that, regardless of strain, the viability of those cells exposed to polymyxin B were more negatively impacted when grown under LSMMG conditions. Similar results were also observed when cells were treated with Triton X-100. Cells of LSMMG-cultivated  V. fischeri , regardless of strain, were also found to be more susceptible to the bactericidal effects of 0.05% Triton X-100, exhibiting more lysis than the gravity controls after 1 min of exposure (Fig.  7 ). To confirm that the results observed during these HARV experiments were not the product of changes to the background pH of the SWT media under LSMMG or gravity conditions, the pH was regularly monitored, and no significant changes to the pH were observed (Supplementary Fig.  7 ).

For all experiments,  V. fischeri  was grown in seawater tryptone broth (SWT; 70% filtered ocean water containing 5 g L −1  tryptone, 3 g L −1  yeast extract, and 32.5 mM glycerol) at 28 ˚C with shaking. Where appropriate, media was supplemented with erythromycin to a final concentration of 5 μg per mL. Retention of the transposon insertions in the  motB1  and  flhA  motility mutants was verified for all experiments via soft-agar motility assays 85 . For assessments of growth, the concentration of  V. fischeri  was determined by reading the optical density at 600 nm, as an OD 600  of 1.0 has been previously shown by plate counts to correspond with 3 × 10 8  cells per mL of culture 84 , 86  and was independently confirmed in the HARVs. To ensure that background levels of OMVs did not significantly alter the OD 600  readings, 1 mL of  V. fischeri  culture was filtered to remove bacteria using a 0.22 µm syringe filter and measured spectrophotometrically. No significant ( p  < 0.0001) difference in optical density was observed in the spent media from background SWT media. Electron microscopy All scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were acquired at the University of Hawai’i Biological Electron Microscopy Facility. For SEM,  V. fischeri  were grown in SWT media to mid-log phase (OD 600  0.4–0.6) with shaking at 28 °C. For TEM, cells were grown under similar conditions in LB salt (LBS) media containing 10 g L −1  tryptone, 5 g L −1  yeast extract, 342 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris at pH 7.5. Samples visualized with SEM were fixed with marine fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 350 mM sucrose, 100 mM sodium cacodylate at pH 7.6 for 1 h. The cells were then washed in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer containing 400 mM sucrose and post-fixed with 100 mM sodium cacodylate containing 1% osmium tetraoxide for 1 h. After fixation the cells were collected on a 0.22-μm filter, then serially dehydrated in ethanol and dried with a Tousimis Samdri-795 critical point dryer. Filters were mounted on aluminum stubs and sputter coated with a Hummer 6.2 sputter coater, then imaged with a Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope with accelerating voltage. TEM was performed as previously described 68 . Briefly,  V. fischeri  cells were fixed, washed, and post-fixed similarly to the samples prepared for SEM. Fixed  V. fischeri  cells were then serially dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, infiltrated with propylene oxide, then embedded and polymerized in LX112 epoxy resin for 2 days.

The growth curves were characteristic of several microbes cultivated under LSMMG, including  V. fischeri , exhibiting increased growth rate during exponential phase compared to gravity controls (Supplementary Fig.  1 ) 23 , 27 , 40 . At each growth interval, the  V. fischeri  cells were removed from the culture media and the level of exogenous LPS shed by the bacteria was measured and compared using two independent assays.

During exponential growth in the HARV reactors,  V. fischeri  cells released significantly more LPS under LSMMG conditions than gravity controls even after being normalized by optical density, an indicator of cell mass (Fig.  2a ). Levels of reactogenic LPS in the surrounding media, as determined by the LAL endotoxin assay, showed a pronounced increase beginning 10 h post inoculation (Fig.  2a ). The significantly higher levels of LPS released from the LSMMG-grown cells continued until ~18–20 h, after which no differences in LPS levels were observed between the two growth conditions. Measurement of total LPS by the Purpald assay showed a similar increase, with the concentrations of total LPS shedding in LSMMG cultivars compared to gravity controls higher at all tested time points between 8 and 24 h post inoculation (Fig.  2b ).

This result led us to determine whether LSMMG stimulates bacterial motility, which would ostensibly increase vesiculation and, as a corollary, the shedding of LPS.

  "discussion": "Discussion Over the coming decade, human-led exploration of space will likely move beyond low Earth orbit into deeper space 50 . Maintaining astronaut fitness during these long-duration space operations will require a detailed understanding of the microbiome under non-terrestrial conditions. To address this emerging issue in space biology, we used the HARV platform to model the effects of microgravity on  V. fischeri , a beneficial microbe known to form symbiotic associations along animal epithelia. Results from this study indicated that (i) LSMMG conditions increased the shedding of bacterial LPS and associated OMVs into the surrounding media; (ii) the size of the OMV particles released during LSMMG were larger than gravity controls; (iii) flagellar motility in  V. fischeri  accounted for most of the overall OMV production, but was not necessary for increases in LPS shedding under LSMMG conditions; and (iv) the cell membranes of  V. fischeri  cells were more susceptible to disruption when cultivated under model microgravity conditions. In Gram-negative bacteria, LPS is localized to the outer membrane and consists of a hydrophobic lipid A moiety, a core polysaccharide, and an O-antigen, or outward-projecting sugar chain of variable length 51 , 52 . LPS represents one of several MAMPs used by bacteria to either evade or communicate with their eukaryotic counterparts 53 . There has been an intense effort in recent years to understand how LPS is recognized by the host immune system through pattern recognition receptors 54 , and how this immune response is altered under microgravity conditions 55 , 56 . The finding that symbiotic  V. fischeri  sheds more LPS under LSMMG conditions closely parallels previous studies that reported that microgravity analogs increases endotoxin load derived from the intestinal microbiota in rodents 55 , 56 . For example, in previous studies using the hindlimb unloading rodent model, a well-established method to simulate musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight 57 , 58 , results indicated that both LPS and the associated host-derived lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were elevated in rodent serum under hindlimb unloading 56 . Levels of circulating LPS were further increased with concurrent exposure to proton or gamma radiation, another environmental hazard of spaceflight 55 . Although the increased levels in the serum were thought to be the result of breakdown of the gut epithelial barrier during hindlimb unloading, the root cause of the overall increased levels of LPS shedding by the microbiota into the host serum was not assessed 55 , 56 . Interestingly, the results observed in  V. fischeri  differ from other host-associated taxa, such as  Salmonella enterica  serovar Typhimurium 17 . In previous studies, HARV-cultivated  Salmonella  exhibited significantly diminished levels of LPS O-antigen in LSMMG lysates, accompanied by a down-regulation of the  rfbP ,  rfbM , and  rfbI  genes involved in O-antigen biosynthes",
