  "abstract": "While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that  Serratia marcescens  (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to  Drosophila melanogaster  after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of  S. marcescens  did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways  Imd  and  Toll , suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.",

  "full_text": "Introduction As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production, 1 – 5  changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution 4 , 6 , 7  and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems. 8 , 9 This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats. 10 – 17  Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight, 18 , 19  increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence. 20 , 21 Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology. 22  The fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight. 23 , 24  Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans. 25 , 26  While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response of  Drosophila melanogaster  is highly similar to humans, 25 , 27 , 28  with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly. 25 , 29 The human opportunistic bacteria  Serratia marcescens  has only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports. 30 , 31  Furthermore,  S. marcescens  has been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS), 32 , 33  suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens.  D. melanogaster  has been recently used as a model for studying  S. marcescens , as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic. 34 – 38  Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans, 34  making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes to  S. marcescens  using a model system. Studies in true spaceflight conditions are difficult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of spaceflight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments, 16 , 17 , 39  which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogen  Serratia marcescens  was sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceflight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space-flown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infect  D. melanogaster  to investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type flies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space-flown and ground-based microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence of  Serratia marcescens  on  D. melanogaster  hosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-flown and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that spaceflight induces a physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of the  D. melanogaster  host and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground. Results Survival of  D. melanogaster  after infection with spaceflight samples Fly survival was significantly lower when infected with spaceflight-exposed  Serratia marcescens  samples compared to the ground control bacterial samples (Fig.  1 ). For the first spaceflight sample (Space 1), survival was significantly different from both Ground 1 ( P  < 0.0001) and Ground 2 ( P  < 0.0001) samples. The same was true for the second spaceflight isolate (Space 2) when compared with ground control samples. Full statistical results are reported in Table  1 . Space 1 and Space 2 were separate samples of bacteria collected from two different plates after spaceflight, and both showed increased virulence compared to ground control bacteria. However they also showed differences between each other in terms of the magnitude of their changes with Space 1 causing greater virulence changes compared to Space 2 samples. This is discussed later in the context of temporary/reversible physiological changes induced by spaceflight vs genetic/heritable changes in the bacteria (see below for “Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample”). Fig. 1 Spaceflight-exposed  Serratia marcescens  show increased virulence in flies. a  Graph showing survival of  w 1118  flies after injection with ground or spaceflight Db11 samples.  b  Graph showing in vivo growth of Db11 after injection into  w 1118  flies.

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2 In vivo growth of spaceflight  S. marcescens  in fly host after injection In vivo growth of injected bacteria was not significantly different between space and ground samples at hours 0 ( F  = 0.9113,  P  = 0.489), 6 ( F  = 0.5316,  P  = 0.6772) or 9 ( F  = 1.169,  P  = 0.3964) post-injection. At hour 12 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 sample was significantly higher in the fly host than the Ground sample ( P  = 0.0002) and Space 2 ( P  = 0.0011). At hour 15 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 remained significantly higher than Ground ( P  = 0.0002) and Space 2 ( P  = 0.04), and Space 2 in vivo growth was significantly higher than Ground ( P  = 0.006) (Fig.  1b ). Therefore, the kinetics of bacterial growth within the host are different for the bacterial cultures returning from space compared to the ground control samples, particularly 12 h and onwards post-infection. In vitro growth of the space-flown bacteria, outside the host, show a similar increase in growth kinetics at later time points compared to the ground control bacteria (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample Given that two separate isolates of bacteria had shown increased virulence after spaceflight exposure (Fig.  1 ), we wanted to assess whether these changes were reversible physiological changes in the bacteria induced by the stress of spaceflight or whether they were genetically heritable changes induced, for instance, by ionizing radiation exposure during spaceflight. After subculturing spaceflight and ground samples of  S. marcescens  in normal Earth gravity overnight, Space 1-injected host survival was not significantly different from either Ground 1 ( P  = 0.995) or Ground 2 ( P  = 0.337) host injected samples. Similarly, Space 2 subculture-infected hosts did not show significant differences in survival from Ground 1 ( P  = 0.5223) or Ground 2 ( P  = 0.113) infected hosts (Fig.  2a ). Full statistical output is reported in Table  2 . These results suggest that the increased virulence detected after spaceflight were temporary changes acquired by the bacteria during spaceflight and that after subculturing under normal conditions on Earth, these differences were no longer detectable after infection of fruit fly hosts.

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2 In vivo growth after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample There was no significant difference of in vivo growth of the spaceflight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig.  2b ) at hours 0 (F = 13.41,  P  = 0.146), 9 ( F  = 0.238,  P  = 0.866), 12 ( F  = 0.443,  P  = 0.731) or 15 ( F  = 0.479,  P  = 0.708) hours post-infection. This data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences detected in virulence of the first ground subcultures in the host (Fig.  2a ). Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria Since spaceflight opportunities are relatively infrequent, a model that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) or the RWV. 15 , 17 , 39  We used the RWV apparatus to assess whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes that we had measured from the spaceflight samples by simulating the low fluid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This is done by rotating the vessel in a perpendicular orientation, where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells. In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed to settle. 11 , 13  Host survival was significantly lower for hosts infected with  S. marcescens  that was grown in LSMMG compared to both the PBS Sham (ratio = 4.42,  P  < 0.0001) and the RWV Control (Ratio = 3.37,  P  = 0.0002) (Fig.  3a ). The RWV Control consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to 1 g Earth’s gravity. 11  Figure  3a  therefore shows that we are able to recreate increased virulence in  S. marcescens  bacteria by simulating microgravity on Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the spaceflight environment is at least one important factor to consider in terms of increased virulence in  S. marcescens . Fig. 3 Simulated microgravity (SMG) can increase virulence of  S. marcescens . a  Graph showing survival of  w 1118  flies after injection with LSMMG-treated (SMG), RWV control-treated or sham-treated Db11 samples, and  b  Graph showing in vivo growth of LSMMG-treated (SMG), RWV control or sham-treated Db11 after injection into  w 1118  flies. Error bars represent one standard error. In vivo growth of LSMMG  S. marcescens There was no significant difference of in vivo growth between the LSMMG and RWV-Control bacteria at hour 0 ( F  = 3.551,  P  = 0.128) or at hour 6 post-infection ( F  = 7.493,  P  = 0.0544). However, there was a significant difference in CFU counts per fly between the LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours 9 ( F  = 20.428,  P  = 0.008), 12 ( F  = 12.455,  P  = 0.019), and 15 ( F  = 18.427,  P  = 0.009) post-infection (Fig.  3b ). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some of the differences observed previously with the spaceflight samples (Fig.  1b ), where the bacterial samples that show increased virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host particularly at later time points. Infection of Immune Deficiency ( Imd ) and  Toll  pathway mutants of  D. melanogaster Since the increase in virulence of spaceflight bacteria was accompanied by an increase in the rate of growth of the bacteria within the fly host, we wanted to determine whether this was a result of a change that the bacteria were able to induce in the host by weakening the hosts’ immune system for example, or whether the bacterial physiology was altered to better withstand the host’s immune defenses. In order to test this hypothesis, we used flies that were mutant in two of the major immune defense pathways in flies, the  Imd  and the  Toll  pathways. 40 , 41  As expected, all  Imd  mutant flies ( PGRP-LC Δ5 , imd 1 , and  relish E20 ) succumb to any  Sm  infections (including ground control  Sm ) much more quickly than either of the wild-type fly lines ( y 1 w*  or  w 1118 )  as seen in Fig.  4a , since the  Imd  pathway is known to be critical for defense against infection with Gram-negative bacteria, 42  such as  Serratia marcescens . On the other hand, the  Toll  pathway is primarily known to be important for defense against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore as expected, there is much less change in the viability of  Toll  deficient mutants ( PGRP-SA seml  and  dif 1 ) after ground control  Sm  infections compared to wild-type flies (Fig.  4c ). Compared to ground control  Sm  however, the spaceflight bacteria Space 1 causes greater lethality in all of the fly lines (compare Fig.  4b  vs a, and  4d  vs c). Therefore the data suggests that regardless of the genotype of the fly host, whether impaired for immune function or robust wild-type lines, the space-flown bacteria causes greater lethality than ground control  Sm . The statistical output is shown in Supplementary Tables  2 – 6 . Fig. 4 Measuring host changes in wild-type and mutant ground flies exposed to space-flown  S. marcescens .

RNA was extracted from infected flies 18 h post-infection. The  x -axis represents the beta-value, an estimator of fold change, and the y-axis represents the −log10 q  value, a  p -value adjusted for false discovery rate. Red dots represent transcripts with  q -value < 0.05, which are considered significantly differentially expressed.  f  PCA of ground, space, and sham injected flies shows no major difference in distribution of the groups between the conditions, with as much variation occurring within conditions as between conditions. RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host To further test whether infection with microgravity-treated bacteria induced changes in gene expression in the ground-reared host, RNA sequencing was performed for wild-type fruit flies after infection with either spaceflight or ground control sample of  S. marcescens . These results showed that there were few significant changes in host gene expression of known immune-related genes when exposed to the two bacterial sample types (Fig.  4e , Supplementary Table  1 ). At the significance threshold ( q -values < 0.05), only eleven transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. However principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abundance across the treatments showed that there is significant overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground bacteria-infected fruit fly hosts (Fig.  4f ). It is worth noting that, since the flies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18 h post-injection, this may have biased the selection of flies in which infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both conditions to a control sham condition shown by PCA supports this idea. Comparing the space bacteria-infected ground flies to the ground bacteria-infected flies, there were a total of 11 differentially expressed genes (see Fig.  4e  and Supplementary Table  1  for gene details). Out of these 11 differentially expressed genes, only  AttA  (Attacin-A) is known to be directly related to the immune response. 43  The gene  AttA  is an antimicrobial peptide that is expressed in the fat body in response to Gram-negative pathogens. 43  The most highly overexpressed gene is  lola  (longitudinals lacking), a gene that is involved in axon growth and guidance in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 44  The next most highly overexpressed gene is  vsg  (visgun), a gene linked to alcohol sensitivity. 45  Among the most underexpressed genes is  eEF2 , is a translation elongation factor, 46  and CG31650 with unknown function. The underexpressed  RhoGEF2  has been recently linked to wound repair, but is primarily involved in the regulation of actin and myosin dynamics through interacting effector proteins. 47  While only one of these genes is directly related to the host immune pathway, follow-up studies will be conducted to elucidate the potential role of these additional differentially expressed genes in the host. Discussion In this study, we found that flies infected with a bacterial pathogen that had been grown during spaceflight was significantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig.  1 ). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains (Fig.  3 ). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the first subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig.  2",
  "introduction": "Introduction As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production, 1 – 5  changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution 4 , 6 , 7  and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems. 8 , 9 This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats. 10 – 17  Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight, 18 , 19  increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence. 20 , 21 Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology. 22  The fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight. 23 , 24  Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans. 25 , 26  While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response of  Drosophila melanogaster  is highly similar to humans, 25 , 27 , 28  with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly. 25 , 29 The human opportunistic bacteria  Serratia marcescens  has only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports. 30 , 31  Furthermore,  S. marcescens  has been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS), 32 , 33  suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens.  D. melanogaster  has been recently used as a model for studying  S. marcescens , as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic. 34 – 38  Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans, 34  making this system an ideal",
  "methods": "Materials and methods D. melanogaster  fly strains Fly lines were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (~24 °C). All fly lines were obtained from Bloomington Stock center including  w 1118  (#3605), OregonR SP2 (no. 2376), relE20 (no. 55714), y 1 w* (no. 55707),  dif 1  (no. 36559),  imd 1  (no. 55711),  PGRP-LC Δ5  (#36323), and  PGRP-SA seml  (#55716). Bacterial growth conditions during spaceflight The hardware used in this study was the FIT (Fly Immunity and Tumors) cassette and changeout platform, as described in our previous  Drosophila  experiments on the ISS. 23 , 66  Food trays were prepared using the methods described below, and stored in a cargo transfer bag (CTB) at 4 °C for launch. Towards the end of the 30 day spaceflight (Fruit Fly Lab – 01 on SpaceX-CRS 5 mission), the food trays containing  S. marcescens  were retrieved from 4 °C storage and placed within the FIT food changeout platform. The platform was placed in a canvas CTB at ISS ambient temperature (23–25 °C) for 5 days, plus 2 days in the SpaceX Dragon (22–25 °C) for undocking/descent and retrieval. During the growth period, environmental data (CO 2 , O 2 , temperature, and relative humidity) was recorded and used to match the growth conditions for ground control experiments. Preparation of  S. marcescens  Db11 for spaceflight Serratia marcescens  Db11 was obtained from the University of Minnesota  C. elegans  stock center. To prepare for the spaceflight experiment, the Db11 strain was grown for 20 h in liquid LB broth with 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C and then diluted to an OD600 of 0.100 in PBS. Next, 100 µL of the diluent was spread onto the surface of two trays containing 2 mL of solid semi-defined fly food media containing 4% Brewer’s yeast (Redstar), 6% glucose, 3% sucrose, 2% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% agar, 0.05% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.05% calcium chloride dihydrate (Sigma), 0.5% of blue food dye (Smart and Final), 0.001% p-hydroxybenzoate, and 0.6% of propionic acid (Sigma) dissolved in water. These two trays were the source of the Space 1 and Space 2 samples that were used in the experiments below. Similarly, we prepared two additional trays (Ground 1 and Ground 2) from the same source sample. These two trays were grown in the same FIT hardware on the ground, inside an incubator (Percival model DR36VL), which was programmed to match the gas composition, temperature, and humidity profiles measured during the flight. After preparing the bacterial sample trays for flight, they were placed into plastic bags and stored at 4 °C, then sent to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-5. Control trays were stored on the ground at 4 °C. Growth conditions on the ISS were described in the previous section. Upon retrieval after the spaceflight mission, bacteria were isolated from the surfaces using sterile cell scrapers and then placed into 50% glycerol and s",

This is consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceflight-induced changes to pathogens, such as  Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus  reverted upon return to Earth conditions. 10 We also sought to understand whether the host immune system may be responding differently to spaceflight-altered bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that space-flown pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared to their ground-reared counterparts, 15 , 16  less is known about how the host immune system may be influenced differently by space-flown pathogens. This is also the first study in spaceflight and in simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes of the pathogen  S. marcescens  in a live host, as previous studies in the field of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on  Salmonella 15  and other microbes. 48 – 50  Utilizing common immune pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the  Imd  or  Toll  pathways were altered, infection with spaceflight sample decreases survival of flies compared to infection with ground sample of  S. marcescens  (Fig.  4 ). Studies in spaceflight and modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered by the presence of symbiotic bacteria. 51  Other studies have shown that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on the specific pathogen used. 52  Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed  Serratia marcescens  compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig.  4c , Supplementary Table  1 ). This antimicrobial peptide is known to respond to Gram-negative pathogens, 43  so an increase in expression in response to  S. marcescens  is expected. However, the increase in expression in space-infected flies compared to ground-infected flies may be due to the increase in bacterial load in the space-infected individuals. Because there is a significant increase of in vivo growth seen in both spacefl",
