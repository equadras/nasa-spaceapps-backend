  "abstract": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.",

More than 50% of the astronauts returning from space shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) have reported a subjective change in their visual acuity 1 . The underlying mechanisms and pathological manifestations of increased vision impairment during and after spaceflight is currently unknown. Various factors have been suggested to account for these disturbances, including increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Modeling studies have shown that a compromise in the integrity of the cerebrovascular barrier function would serve to elevate ICP 2 . Similar to how the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions in the cranium, the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is an endothelial barrier which regulates vascular permeability and maintains intraocular pressure (IOP). Little work has been done to examine retinal structure and BRB integrity/function following prolonged exposure to spaceflight in animal models. Spaceflight has been reported to have numerous negative effects on ocular and structure and function 3 . However, data on how spaceflight impacts protein expression in the retina are limited. We have previously evaluated ocular tissue responses obtained from mice flown to and from the ISS on both the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) 4  as well as the SpaceX-9 Dragon rocket 5 . Although numerous differences were noted in the flight mice compared to control animals on ground, an intriguing finding especially relevant to the present study was that spaceflight conditions induced significant changes in protein expression related to endothelial apoptosis, inflammation and metabolic function in the retina. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on retinal vascular alterations and BRB integrity, and to identify changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue following spaceflight using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a proteomics approach. Results IOP measurement Tukey’s post hoc comparison showed that IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg, p < 0.05) in the left eye of the flight (FLT) mice (Fig.  1A ). However, there were no significant differences in IOP measurements in the right eye (Fig.  1B ). Figure 1 Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. ( A ) Mean pre-and post-flight IOP for flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) mice for left eyes (n = 20). ( B ) Mean pre-and post-flight IOP for FLT and GC mice for right eyes (n = 20). The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Six readings were made to obtain an average count as a single IOP readout. Three IOP measurements were obtained for each eye. Values are means ± SEM.  * Significantly lower than that of preflight (p < 0.05). Apoptotic damage in the retina Representative images of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay were presented for FLT, habitat ground controls (GC) and vivarium control conditions, including both flight vivarium (FV) and ground vivarium (GV) control groups (Fig.  2A ). Quantitative assessment indicated that the density of apoptotic cells in the retinal nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer (GCL) was significantly higher in the FLT group, and was 2–2.5 fold higher compared to that in the GC group (Fig.  2B ). The number of TUNEL positive endothelial cells were also calculated (Fig.  2C ). A significant increase of apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells was detected ranging from 1.6 to 2.0-fold for FLT group compared to ground and vivarium controls, respectively (p < 0.05). Figure 2 Apoptosis based on terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining of male C57BL/6 flight (FLT), ground control (GC) mouse retinal tissue. ( A ) TUNEL-positive cells were identified with green fluorescence, endothelium was stained with lectin (red). TUNEL-positive cells that were laid within red lectin-labeled endothelium were identified as TUNEL-positive endothelial cells. The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In the control retinal tissue, only sparse TUNEL-positive cells were found. In the retina from flight mice, TUNEL-positive labeling was apparent in the retinal endothelial cells, nuclear layers and ganglion cell layers. Arrow: TUNEL-positive endothelial cell. Outer nuclear layer (ONL); inner nuclear layer (INL); ganglion cell layer (GCL). Scale bar = 50 μm.

Values are represented as mean density ± SEM for 6 mice/group, and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic positive cells/mm 2 . The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM for 6 mice/group.  * Significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.05). BRB integrity and endothelial proteins Two astrocyte markers were used to examine the integrity of the BRB: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4). GFAP is present in the cell bodies and large processes of astrocytes. It is an intermediate filament protein involved in the maintenance of the BRB. (Fig.  3A ). AQP-4 is a water channel protein concentrated at the luminal surfaces of astrocyte end-feet which clearly outline the vascular bed to which they adhere. In the retina, AQP4 is expressed in glia cells (astrocyte and Müller cells) and is responible for BRB integrity. Increased positive AQP4 staining (green) was seen in the retinal GCL and inner nuclear layer (INL) of the FLT group (Fig.  3A ) compared with ground controls. As shown in Fig.  3B , the fluorescent intensity reflecting endogenous levels of AQP-4 in the retina was significantly greater in the FLT group compared with the GC group (p < 0.01). There was no signficant differences between three control groups; the average intensities were 36.9 +/− 3.0, 34.9 +/− 1.9 and 35.1 +/− 3.6 for the GC, GV and FV groups respectively. There was no notable difference in the pattern and instensity of GFAP staining. Figure 3 Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) staining in the retina. ( A ) Representative micrographs of ocular sections after immunostaining with anti-GFAP and AQP-4 antibodies on flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) samples. AQP-4 positive staining is identified by green fluorescence, GFAP with red, and the cell nuclei with blue (DAPI). Increased AQP-4 staining was seen in the FLT group compared with controls. No significant differences in GFAP staining was noted between two groups. Scale bar = 50 μm. ( B ) The average fluorescence intensity for AQP-4 was measured and calculated using the ImageJ program. Fluorescence was averaged across 6 retinas per group. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM.  * Significantly higher than ground control (GC) groups (p < 0.05). To examine whether spaceflight alters cellular expression of the endothelial cell juction proteins and retinal barrier integrity, the eye tissue expression of the endothelial cell-cell adhesion molecule, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) and tight junction (TJ) proteins, such as Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were evaluated. In FLT mice, increased immunoreactivity for PECAM-1 (red) was predominantly present in GCL (Fig.  4A ). PECAM-1 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the FLT group compared to GC mice (Fig.  4B ). Furthermore, ZO-1 expression (red) was detected at the GCL and the photorecepotor inner segment (IS) of the eye tissues (Fig.  5A ). The level of ZO-1 immunoactivity tended to be lower (p = 0.062) in the FLT group compared to that in GC controls (Fig.  5B ).

PECAM-1 positive cells were identified with red fluorescence, endothelium was stained with lectin (green). The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In the control retinal tissue, only some positive cells were found. In the retina from flight mice, enhanced immunoreactivity of PECAM cells was apparent in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layers (GCL). Scale bar = 50 μm.

Proteomics analysis of mouse ocular tissues Twenty micrograms of protein from retina samples in the GC and FLT groups were resolved by 4–20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Tris-Gly gel electrophoresis, visualized by Coomassie stain, in-gel trypsin digested, and analyzed by LC/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer. A MaxQuant database search (restricted to  Mus musculus ) identified a total of 6,634 proteins from all 12 samples with 6,353 (96%) proteins identified in common among the GC and FLT samples (Fig.  6 ). MaxQuant iBAQ intensity values were median normalized, log 2  transformed, and missing values were imputed based on the normal distribution using Perseus (version 1.5.6.0) 6 . Batch effects were corrected using the ComBat function from the sva bioconductor package 7 . The log 2  normalized iBAQ intensity values were used for statistical analysis. A Mann-Whitney U test was performed and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the FDR level. Figure 6 Venn diagram of the total number of proteins identified in the retinas of ground control and flight mice. 95.8% of the proteins were identified in both groups, while 2.7% and 1.6% of proteins identified were unique to ground control and flight, respectively. We identified a total of 6,634 proteins of which 485 significantly differentiated in FLT compared to GC by FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table  1 ). These proteins are shown as a heatmap using a hierarchical cluster of the log 2  normalized iBAQ intensities for all samples (Fig.  7 ). The significant protein profile is able to clearly separate the two groups. This list was then reduced to 224 significant proteins when we included a fold change >2 cutoff (Supplementary Table  2 ). Volcano plots were generated to visualize all identified proteins and highlight significant proteins. The y-axis consists of −log 10 \n p -values based on the Mann–Whitney U FDR adjusted  p -values, while the  x -axis consists of the log 2  fold change. The vertical lines indicate up- and down expression using a fold change >2 threshold. The horizontal line indicates a  p -value of 0.05 (Fig.  8 ). A total of 126 proteins were up-regulated while 98 proteins were down-regulated in FLT compared to GC. Ten most significantly increased and decreased protein expression levels related to cellular organization, cell cycle, apoptosis, circadian clock, neuronal and mitochondrial function are summarized and listed in Table  1 . These differentially expressed proteins were then analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA,  https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis ) 8 . Pathways were considered significant based on the Fisher exact test with a −log10 p-value > 1.3 (corresponds to a p-value < 0.05). IPA revealed significant changes in pathways related to cell death, adhesion juction/tight junction signaling, calcium signaling, mitochondrial function and metabolism. Significantly affected canonical pathways between GC and FLT groups are shown in Fig.  9 . Figure 7 Hierarchical cluster of significantly differentiating proteins between ground control (GC) and flight (FLT). The log 2  normalized iBAQ intensities are shown. Proteins were considered significant with a FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 and are clustered along the top of the heatmap. The proteins clearly separate the two sample groups. Figure 8 Volcano plot showing all 6,634 identified proteins in the retina of ground control and flight mice. The y-axis consists of −log 10 \n p -values based on the Mann–Whitney U FDR adjusted  p -values, while the  x -axis consists of the log 2  fold change. The vertical lines indicate a fold change >2 threshold. The horizontal line indicates a  p -value of 0.05. Proteins highlighted in red were significant at a fold change >2 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05. Proteins in the upper left quadrant have an increased expression in the ground control (GC) group, whereas proteins in the upper right quadrant are increased in flight (FLT) group.

Discussion The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the retinal vasculature and possible alterations in BRB integrity, and to identify spaceflight-induced proteomic significance and biomarkers in mouse ocular tissue. The data demonstrate that spaceflight induces apoptosis in the retinal vascular endothelial cells and photoreceptors (Fig.  2 ), as well as evokes alterations in vascular levels of AQP-4 (Fig.  3 ), PECAM-1 (Fig.  4 ) and ZO-1 (Fig.  5 ), proteins related to BRB integrity. These changes in BRB characteristics suggest decrements in barrier function in the eye. Protein expression profiles and pathway analysis also provide evidence that spaceflight induces changes in cellular organization, cell cycle, mitochondrial function, circadian clock and oxidative stress in the retina. Collectively, these observations are consistent with and extend previous findings in rodents exposed to a weightless environment 4 , 5  and suggest that spaceflight involves a complex combination of stressors that leads to alterations and impairment of ocular structure and function. Little is known about the impact of spaceflight on the BRB, but in disease states such as diabetes, where the BRB is compromised and microvascular permeability is elevated, visual impairment similar to the visual disturbances experienced by astronauts often occurs 9 , 10 . At least one recent study has shown that a compromise in the integrity of the vascular BRB causes vision-threatening vascular dysfunction 11 . Damage to microvascular endothelial cells is one of the major factors thought to underlie the increased permeability of the BRB in diabetic patients 9 , 10 . Radiation, another environmental stressor inherent to spaceflight, also induces disruption of endothelial barrier integrity 12 , 13 . In the present study, we found the spaceflight induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity and function, including APQ-4, PECAM-1 and ZO-1. The water channel protein AQP-4 has a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of BRB by forming a functional complex at astrocytic endfeet membranes 14 . The upregulation of AQP-4 in flight retinal GCL and INL indicate the potential for barrier integrity disruption and edema formation. PECAM-1 is highly expressed at endothelial cell-cell junctions, where it functions as an adhesive stress-response protein to maintain endothelial cell junctional integrity 15 . It is important for leukocyte-endothelium interactions, including the migration of leukocytes across the endothelium during inflammation 16 . PECAM-1 has also been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of vascular degeneration 17 . Increased expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, including PECAM-1, has also been associated with BRB disruption after retinal vascular injury 18 . The higher PECAM-1 expression in retina following spaceflight may consequently facilitate inflammatory cells to cross the BRB due to prolonged changes in the BRB permeability 19 . The integrity of the BRB is also dependent on TJs, and possibly adherent junctions, among endothelial cells 20 . Many studies have shown that vascular permeability is altered by decreasing the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1 21 . Indeed, the degradation of TJ-associated proteins in retinal vessels following injury has been shown to lead to retinal vascular disorganization and BRB breakdown 14 . We found a tendency for a lower expression of TJ-associated protein ZO-1, which is mostly expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells 22 . The greater apoptosis of retinal vascular endothelial cells coupled with alterations in retinal vascular AQP-4, PECAM-1 and ZO-1 levels in FLT mice collectively suggest that spaceflight increases the risk for BRB disruption, leading to possible ocular impairment and injury. After returning from long-duration spaceflight missions, many astronauts have been diagnosed with ocular structural and visual changes 23 . Studies have shown that changes in the gravitational environment can have pronounced transient and sustained effects on the eye 24 . Microgravity-induced vision changes may result from the interaction of multiple physiological factors, including changes in IOP, fluid shifts, ocular geometry and cardiovascular alterations 25 – 27 . Similarly, increases in IOP have been ",

  "methods": "Material and Methods Flight and control conditions On August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Due to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay. Tissue collection with the FV group were conducted several days after studies with the FLT animals were concluded.

The water channel protein AQP-4 has a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of BRB by forming a functional complex at astrocytic endfeet membranes 14 . The upregulation of AQP-4 in flight retinal GCL and INL indicate the potential for barrier integrity disruption and edema formation. PECAM-1 is highly expressed at endothelial cell-cell junctions, where it functions as an adhesive stress-response protein to maintain endothelial cell junctional integrity 15 . It is important for leukocyte-endothelium interactions, including the migration of leukocytes across the endothelium during inflammation 16 . PECAM-1 has also been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of vascular degeneration 17 . Increased expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, including PECAM-1, has also been associated with BRB disruption after retinal vascular injury 18 . The higher PECAM-1 expression in retina following spaceflight may consequently facilitate inflammatory cells to cr",
