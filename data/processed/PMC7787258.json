  "abstract": "SUMMARY Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low-earth orbit, the moon, and beyond.  Drosophila  can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. Remarkably, in long-QT causing  sei/hERG  mutants, proteasomal gene expression at 1 g , although less than the wild-type expression, was nevertheless increased in microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.",

This drive to go “where no man has gone before,” coupled with increasing pollution, climate change, and competition for scarcer resources, has brought humans to the point at which exploration and exploitation of other celestial bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, and other planets, is inevitable. However, our organ systems have evolved to work under 1 g , and it is not clear what the effect of long-term exposure to lower gravity environments might be and how those effects are exerted at the cellular and molecular levels. Cardiac health has been a major concern of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for many years, but the clinical evidence for decreased function and unmasking of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease is limited. Early studies performed on astronauts who had been in microgravity for only a few weeks to a few months failed to uncover any cardiac effects ( Hamilton et al., 2011 ), and some studies suggested that changes in function could be explained by dehydration ( Summers et al., 2005 ). However, the number of subjects examined in those studies was low, with sometimes conflicting results, and they were without discernable (cardiac) health risks, so it is difficult to draw conclusions. Experiments designed to mimic longer-term exposure to microgravity (bed rest in humans and hind limb unloading in mice) showed reductions in cardiac contractility ( Platts et al., 2009 ) and increases in arrhythmia ( Respress et al., 2014 ). Increases in ventricular contraction (QT) intervals have also been reported in astronauts after longer-duration flights ( D’Aunno et al., 2003 ), suggesting reductions in the cardiac repolarization reserve ( Akoum et al., 2011 ), but those conclusions are again based on few subjects with differing genetic backgrounds. Dysfunction in several cardiac ion channels are known to cause long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene, also known to code for the hERG channel, is one of the ion channels that contribute to LQTS. hERG channel dysfunction can be caused by alterations in the genes encoding this channel as well as by some commonly used medications ( Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006 ). To systematically explore the effects of spaceflight on the heart, we used the  Drosophila  cardiac model to examine how prolonged exposure to microgravity affects cardiac health. We report the effects of microgravity on heart function in wild-type (WT) fruit flies ( Drosophila  Canton-S [CS]) that were born, developed, and spent 1–3 weeks as adults aboard the International Space Station (ISS) compared with their ground-based controls ( Figure 1A ). We also examined the effects of microgravity on flies with mutations in  seizure  ( sei ), the fly homolog of the human hERG gene. Our results show that structural and functional cardiac remodeling occurs in response to microgravity and that remodeling is more severe in the channel mutants. Cardiac RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of WT and  sei/hERG  mutant flies and follow-up immunohistochemistry studies suggest that alterations in proteostasis likely contribute to the observed changes in cardiac function in microgravity. RESULTS Lifelong Microgravity Exposure Caused Cardiac Dysfunction and Remodeling We used vented fly boxes (VFBs) to carry multiple vials of adult  Drosophila , each with 10 females and 5 males, to the ISS (see protocol schematic;  Figure 1A ). Eggs laid on the food in the bottom of the vials hatched into larva that then metamorphosed into adults in about 10–12 days, all under microgravity. VFBs and vials containing live adult flies were returned to earth gravity, and flies were processed within ~2 days of exposure to 1 g  (space-flown [SF] flies). We also collected flies that emerged from those same vials at 1 g  (days 3–5 after splash down) and aged them for 2 weeks at 1 g  before processing (space flight recovery [SFR]). For cardiac function assays, flies were dissected under artificial hemolymph and allowed to equilibrate for 15–30 min in fresh, aerated, artificial hemolymph. The contracting hearts were filmed with high-speed digital cameras (140–160 frames/s [fps]) for subsequent heart-function analysis ( Fink et al., 2009 ;  Ocorr et al., 2007 ). Measurements of heart diameters were made at the widest portion of the second abdominal chamber during systole and diastole. Exposure to microgravity resulted in significant reductions in end-diastolic diameters (EDDs) of SF CS female fly hearts compared with hearts from ground controls (GCs) ( Figure 1B , top left). This reduction was not the result of changes in the overall size of female flies because there was no significant difference in body length in response to microgravity ( Figure S1A ). There was a trend toward reduced diastolic diameters in male flies, which did not reach statistical significance, as well as a small reduction in the overall body length of SF CS males ( Figures 1B , bottom left, and  S1A ). No significant effects of microgravity were observed on end-systolic diameters (ESDs) under microgravity in either sex ( Figure 1C ). Importantly, both sexes showed significant decreases in fractional shortening ([EDD – ESD]/[EDD]), which is an indirect measure of cardiac contractility ( Figure 1D ). The functional consequence of reduced diameters in females was a highly significant reduction in cardiac output ( Figure 1E ). As previously observed ( Ocorr et al., 2017 ), cardiac size and output in  sei/hERG  mutant hearts were already significantly reduced at 1 g  compared with CS hearts ( Figures 1B  and  1C ). Interestingly, there was a small but significant increase in diastolic diameters in response to microgravity in hearts from female  sei/hERG  mutants, which translated into a modest increase in the cardiac output ( Figure 1C , top). The length of time the heart spent in diastole and systole was also quantified from high-speed movies. There were no significant differences between 1 g - and microgravity-exposed flies ( Figures S1B  and  S1C ). However, hearts from female SFR flies did show a significant increase in the systolic intervals, perhaps a response to increased load when returned to 1 g . Male CS hearts showed significantly increased cardiac arrhythmia ( Figure S1D , bottom; arrhythmia index [AI], a measure of beat-to-beat variability) ( Ocorr et al., 2007 ), which was not seen in SFR flies. The AI trended higher in females but did not reach the level of significance ( Figure S1D , top). We observed the expected bradycardia and increased arrhythmia in  sei/hERG  mutant flies compared with CS controls at 1 g , but it was not significantly worsened in microgravity ( Figures S1B - S1D ). Representative high-speed videos of hearts from both lines reared under 1 g  and microgravity are provided ( Video S1 ). Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Differential Expression in Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and Proteasome Regulatory Genes under Microgravity After filming for cardiac functional analyses, hearts were removed and processed for transcriptomic analysis. Hierarchical-cluster analyses from triplicate samples from CS 1 g  (CS_G), CS microgravity-exposed (CS_S), sei/hERG 1 g  (sei_G), and sei/hERG-microgravity-exposed (sei_S) flies were performed. The results showed that triplicates from each genotype and condition clustered within their respective group. Genotypes clustered at shorter distances then those with microgravity exposure. Hearts from WT CS flies reared in microgravity compared with 1 g  GCs showed upregulation of 250 genes (1.25-fold; adjusted [adj.] p value ≤ 0.05); of which, 86 genes were increased ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01) ( Figure 2B ). Ontological analysis of the 250 upregulated genes using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation bioinformatics microarray analysis showed an ~20-fold enrichment in proteasome-mediated ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent protein catabolism genes, a 23-fold enrichment in chromatin assembly and disassembly genes, and a 12-fold enrichment in genes with endopeptidase activity, among other ontologies ( Table 1 ). Conversely, 618 genes were downregulated (1.25-fold; adj. p value ≤ 0.05); of which, 313 genes were decreased ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01) ( Figure 2B ). Here, ontological analysis identified 2-fold or greater enrichment in gene subsets enriched for proteolysis, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and the ECM ( Table 1 ). Transcriptomic analysis of hearts from GC  sei/hERG  mutants compared with GC CS flies ( Figures 2A  and  2B ) showed upregulation of 1,111 genes (1.25-fold; adj. p value ≤ 0.05), with 525 genes showing increased expression ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01). Ontological analysis of the 1,111 upregulated genes showed a 5.8-fold enrichment in chromatin assembly genes, 2-fold enrichment in proteolysis genes, and 2.9-fold increase in carbohydrate metabolic process genes, among other ontologies ( Table 2 ). Conversely, 865 genes were downregulated (1.25-fold; adj. p value ≤ 0.05), with 256 genes ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01) ( Figures 2A  and  2B ). Here, ontological analysis revealed a 4.4-fold enrichment in proteasome-mediated Ub-dependent catabolism genes, 1.9-fold enrichment in fatty-acid-elongation genes, and a 2.2-fold enrichment in cellular response to DNA damage genes, among other ontologies. Importantly, expression of many ECM-related genes in hearts from  sei/hERG  GC flies was already significantly reduced compared with WT GCs ( Table 2 ). Transcriptomic analysis of hearts from  sei/hERG  mutants showed exposure to microgravity resulted in the upregulation of 840 genes (1.25-fold; adj. p value ≤ 0.05), with 96 genes increased ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01) ( Figure 2B ). Ontological analysis of the 840 upregulated genes showed a 5.4-fold enrichment in rRNA processing genes and a 4.8-fold enrichment in histone acetyltransferase genes, among other ontologies ( Table 3 ). Conversely, 1,063 genes were downregulated (1.25-fold; adj. p value ≤ 0.05), with 582 genes decreased ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01) ( Figure 2B ). Here, ontological analysis revealed a 2.4-fold enrichment in oxidative-reduction, a 2.2-fold enrichment in proteolysis, and a 5.8-fold enrichment in cell adhesion via plasma membrane genes among other ontologies ( Table 3 ). We identified 38 genes that were commonly upregulated and 189 genes that were commonly downregulated in both WT and mutant hearts under microgravity ( Figure 2B ). Within the 38 commonly upregulated genes, we identified multiple proteasomal/Ub-dependent protein catabolic genes, including ProsAlpha6, Rpn13, Npl4, and CG2046 ( Table S1 ). Within the 189 downregulated genes, there was a 7.9-fold enrichment in carbohydrate metabolic process genes ( Table S2 ;  Figure S2 ). Half of those genes mapped specifically to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway and included key conserved enzymes, such as  Agat4, Gpdh1, Gpd2, and Gapdh1  ( Figure S2 ). Among downregulated genes, there was also a 3.2-fold enrichment in genes encoding proteins found in the ECM. In addition, oxidation-reduction and proteolysis genes were enriched in commonly downregulated genes ( Table S2 ; see also  Figure S2 ). Nineteen genes were contra-regulated. Volcano plots ( Figure 2C ) show the relative distribution of differentially expressed genes in CS and  sei/hERG , normalized to their respective GCs. In general, more genes were downregulated than were upregulated under microgravity, with more genes differentially expressed at a higher magnitude in  sei  compared with CS. Adjusted read-count data for all samples have been provided ( Data S1 ). It should be noted that fruit fly hearts are very small, and the material isolated was insufficient to validate our RNA-seq analyses, which were run in triplicate, with qPCR. Microgravity Exposure Caused Myofibrillar and ECM Remodeling of the Heart We examined the cardiac morphology of GC and microgravity-reared flies in a subset of hearts used for the functional assays. Phalloidin staining of filamentous actin (F-actin) revealed the myofibrillar structure within the myocardial cells that make up the heart tube ( Figures 3A - 3D ). In CS GC hearts, the myofibrils are typically tightly packed and circumferentially arranged within those cells ( Figure 3A ), such that shortening of the sarcomeres results in a squeezing of the heart tube and ejection of the hemolymph present within the heart lumen ( Video S1 ). Hearts from flies exposed to microgravity have myofibrils that are much more loosely arranged, with gaps, and were organized in a more-longitudinal orientation compared with 1 g  controls ( Figures 3A  and  3B ). Myofibrillar reorganization or remodeling has previously been documented in hearts from  sei/hERG  mutants ( Ocorr et al., 2017 ) and was again observed in hearts from 1 g \n sei/hERG  GCs ( Figure 3C ). However, hearts from  sei/hERG  mutants reared in microgravity showed even-more-extensive myofibrillar reorganization and disarray than GCs, and F-actin staining was diminished compared with GCs ( Figure 3D ). To further quantify myofibrillar structure, we calculated relative sarcomere lengths from our F-actin-stained z stack images ( Figure S3 ) by quantifying the number of sarcomeres per 30-μm myofilament length. Sarcomere number was significantly reduced under microgravity for both female and male Canton-S flies ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that hearts from SF flies were capable of generating less force than their GC siblings. Sarcomere counts in Canton-S SFR hearts were not different from GC hearts and, for heart diameters, there were no significant differences among any of the hearts from sei/hERG mutants ( Figure S3 ). In conjunction with the myofibrillar remodeling, we also observed a significant reorganization of the ECM surrounding the heart. In the  Drosophila  heart, this extracellular network consists primarily of the collagen IV homolog pericardin. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that network of collagen IV fibers surrounding the heart ( Figure 3 ), and we show that it partially co-localizes with the z-band protein α-actinin ( Figures S4A - S4H ). In GC CS flies, those collagen fibers run orthogonally over the myofibrils of myocardial cells ( Figures 3A  and  3E ) to form what appears to be a stabilizing network. Hearts from female CS flies reared in microgravity showed noticeable reductions in that myofiber-associated network ( Figures 3B  and  3F ), consistent with the myofibrillar remodeling. Quantification of the cardiac muscle associated networks showed that this reduction was significant in SF female hearts ( Figure 3G ), although the decrease seen for CS male flies did not reach significance ( Figure 3G ). This result was unexpected because cardiomyopathy from compromised heart function is usually accompanied by  increased  collagen deposition, i.e., fibrosis. This myofibril-associated collagen network in  sei/hERG  mutant GCs ( Figures 3C  and  3G ) was already significantly reduced compared with that of CS GCs ( Figures 3B  and  3G ), also likely a reflection of the previously observed myofibrillar remodeling in these mutants at 1 g  ( Ocorr et al., 2017 ). Interestingly, we did observe  intra-chamber  fibrosis in a large percentage of hearts analyzed from  sei  mutants on the ground (arrows in  Figures 2C″ , 3C , and  3C′ ), something we rarely observed in CS flies at 1 g  or microgravity. At 1 g , 60% of  sei/hERG  versus 1% of CS females and 65% of  sei/hERG  versus 16% CS males showed evidence of intra-chamber collagen IV localization (p < 0.005, Mann Whitney unpaired t test for both males and females). Unexpectedly, most hearts from SF  sei/hERG  females exhibited only faint collagen fibers, and there were large globular aggregates of collagen in the cardiac lumen as well as deposits that appeared to fill-in gaps between myofibrils ( Figures 3D ,  3D′ , and  3D″ ). Hearts from SF  sei/hERG  males exhibited more-extensive pericardin networks compared with SF  sei/hERG  females, but those networks were also reduced in microgravity compared with  sei/hERG  male GCs ( Figure 3G ). The observed structural and morphological changes ( Figures 3A - 3D  and  3G ) correlate with a complex misexpression of various cardiac sarcomeric genes, ( Figure 3H , top). Control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of human actin orthologs, including  Actin88F  (hACTB) and  Actin79b  (hACTA/B). However, unique to CS, expression of the sarcomeric organizational gene  basigin  (hBSG), z-band localized metabolic genes  GAPDH1  and  GPDH , and unconventional myosin  jaguar  ( jar ) (hMYO6) were reduced, whereas the later three were upregulated in  sei/hERG  flies under 1 g . Conversely, sarcomeric organizational gene  rolling pebbles  ( rols ) (hTANC2) was upregulated in CS in microgravity. Interestingly, reduced expression of a variety of myosin-related genes was observed exclusively in  sei/hERG  mutants under microgravity, including  myosin heavy chain  ( Mhc ) (hMHC7),  myosin light chain1  ( Mlh1 ) (hMYL1),  Myo10A  (hMYO15A), and  Tropomyosin 1  (Tm1) (hTPM1). Additionally, the observed changes in ECM content and morphology also correlated with misexpression of collagen/ECM regulatory genes ( Figure 3H , bottom). Both control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of  procollagen lysyl hydroxylase  ( plod ) (hPLOD1-3) and  lysyl oxidase-1  ( lox ) (hLOXL2). These collagen maturation genes promote collagen cross-linking and ECM formation. However, in SF CS flies, the collagen network degradative gene,  matrix metalloproteinase 1  ( MMP1 ) (hMMP14/24), was also downregulated. In  sei/hERG  mutants, cardiac  MMP1  expression was elevated under both gravity conditions, relative to CS. However, for CS,  MMP2  (hMMP15) expression was reduced in microgravity. CS flies exhibited a reduction in multiple collagen-type-IV-encoding genes, including  Cg25C  (hCOL4A1),  viking  ( vkg ) (hCOL4A1),  Col4a1 (hCOL4A1/2/6), and  pericardin  ( prc ), as well as collagen and fibrinogen domain containing CG30280 (hFIBCD1) and CG31832 (hFCN1). Interestingly, most of these genes are upregulated in  sei/hERG  at 1 g  compared with CS, as would be expected under pathological cardiac remodeling conditions. Nevertheless, their expression shows a similar reduction under microgravity. The notable exceptions are the elevated CG30282 (see  Figure 3H ) expression in  sei/hERG  mutants, which remains high in space. Importantly, this misexpression of cell adhesion genes may underlie the observed misregulation of the pericardin network under microgravity ( Figure S5 ). Proteasome Numbers Are Significantly Increased in Hearts from SF Flies Remarkably, nearly all the genes encoding proteasome subunits were significantly upregulated under microgravity in hearts from CS WT flies ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, at 1 g , proteasome gene expression was already reduced in the hearts from  sei/hERG  mutants relative to CS. Nevertheless, microgravity exposure also resulted in upregulation of cardiac proteasome genes in  sei/hERG  mutants relative to their  sei/hERG  GCs ( Figure 4A ), albeit to levels that were still reduced relative to CS GCs. Our observation that cardiac proteasome gene expression was significantly upregulated in response to microgravity suggested that protein folding had been compromised and/or degradation was elevated. We had a fortunate and unique opportunity to test that hypothesis on a subsequent mission launched to the ISS aboard SpaceX commercial resupply service (CRS)-11 using the same protocol as for CRS-03. For this study, we generated flies that expre",

Eggs laid on the food in the bottom of the vials hatched into larva that then metamorphosed into adults in about 10–12 days, all under microgravity. VFBs and vials containing live adult flies were returned to earth gravity, and flies were processed within ~2 days of exposure to 1 g  (space-flown [SF] flies). We also collected flies that emerged from those same vials at 1 g  (days 3–5 after splash down) and aged them for 2 weeks at 1 g  before processing (space flight recovery [SFR]). For cardiac function assays, flies were dissected under artificial hemolymph and allowed to equilibrate for 15–30 min in fresh, aerated, artificial hemolymph. The contracting hearts were filmed with high-speed digital cameras (140–160 frames/s [fps]) for subsequent heart-function analysis ( Fink et al., 2009 ;  Ocorr et al., 2007 ). Measurements of heart diameters were made at the widest portion of the second abdominal chamber during systole and diastole. Exposure to microgravity resulted in significant reductions in end-diastolic diameters (EDDs) of SF CS female fly hearts compared with hearts from ground controls (GCs) ( Figure 1B , top left). This reduction was not the result of changes in the overall size of female flies because there was no significant difference in body length in response to microgravity ( Figure S1A ). There was a trend toward reduced diastolic diameters in male flies, which did not reach statistical significance, as well as a small reduction in the overall body length of SF CS males ( Figures 1B , bottom left, and  S1A ). No significant effects of microgravity were observed on end-systolic diameters (ESDs) under microgravity in either sex ( Figure 1C ). Importantly, both sexes showed significant decreases in fractional shortening ([EDD – ESD]/[EDD]), which is an indirect measure of cardiac contractility ( Figure 1D ). The functional consequence of reduced diameters in females was a highly significant reduction in cardiac output ( Figure 1E ). As previously observed ( Ocorr et al., 2017 ), cardiac size and output in  sei/hERG  mutant hearts were already significantly reduced at 1 g  compared with CS hearts ( Figures 1B  and  1C ). Interestingly, there was a small but significant increase in diastolic diameters in response to microgravity in hearts from female  sei/hERG  mutants, which translated into a modest increase in the cardiac output ( Figure 1C , top). The length of time the heart spent in diastole and systole was also quantified from high-speed movies. There were no significant differences between 1 g - and microgravity-exposed flies ( Figures S1B  and  S1C ). However, hearts from female SFR flies did show a significant increase in the systolic intervals, perhaps a response to increased load when returned to 1 g . Male CS hearts showed significantly increased cardiac arrhythmia ( Figure S1D , bottom; arrhythmia index [AI], a measure of beat-to-beat variability) ( Ocorr et al., 2007 ), which was not seen in SFR flies. The AI trended higher in females but did not reach the level of significance ( Figure S1D , top). We observed the expected bradycardia and increased arrhythmia in  sei/hERG  mutant flies compared with CS controls at 1 g , but it was not significantly worsened in microgravity ( Figures S1B - S1D ).

  "discussion": "DISCUSSION As humans increasingly venture into our interplanetary space, it will be important to understand the different ways in which prolonged exposure to altered  g  forces affect organ systems that have evolved under 1 g . Muscle function is known to be affected by prolonged weightlessness, but most studies address the “bulk” properties of muscle fibers, leaving the cellular and mechanistic causes relatively unexplored. Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of filaments is important because those filaments reveal how molecular properties scale up and how bulk properties of muscle fibers are dictated by nanoscale phenomena. The current work, using the genetically tractable  Drosophila  model, provides new and unique insights into microgravity effects on muscle cells at the molecular level and also facilitates insightful structural and functional cardiac phenotyping at the organismal level. Similar to humans, exposure to microgravity has profound effects on fly muscle function, as has been previously reported for flies exposed to microgravity for short durations (2 weeks) ( Miller and Keller, 1999 ). Heart function analysis in our denervated, semi-intact preparations confirmed a cardiac-specific effect of space flight, with heart chamber size and cardiac contractility and output being significantly reduced under microgravity ( Figures 1B ,  1D , and  1E ). These findings were consistent with observed myofibrillar remodeling ( Figures 3A - 3D ), reduced sarcomere count ( Figure S3 ), and misregulation of sarcomeric genes ( Figure 3H ), including actins, myosins and tropomyosin, and sarcomere organizational genes. Troponin mutations that interfere with tropomyosin binding have already been documented in the fly heart to cause cardiac dysfunction, cardiac restriction, and myofibrillar disarray ( Madan et al., 2020 ;  Viswanathan et al., 2014 ), similar to our observation in space flies. In addition, we previously observed that specific myosin-transducer mutations that affect rates of ATP hydrolysis have differential effects on myofibrillar structure, including restrictive (when rates are faster) and dilatory (when rates are slower) cardiomyopathies ( Cammarato et al., 2008 ). We have also shown that mutations in unc-45, a chaperone involved in myosin protein folding, significantly alter myofibrillar structure in the fly heart ( Melkani et al., 2011 ). Although a role for Myo10A (Sisyphus) has not yet been described in the heart, it has been shown to promote transport of cell-adhesion cargo and to bind integrins, which we have previously shown to be critical to cardiac structure and function ( Nishimura et al., 2014 ), thus suggesting a possible role for this unconventional myosin in the heart. Sarcomeric contractile and structural proteins provide the fundamental molecular basis for cardiac function and have well-established roles in the etiology of a variety of cardiac diseases ( Marston, 2018 ). Our studies show that prolonged exposure to m",
