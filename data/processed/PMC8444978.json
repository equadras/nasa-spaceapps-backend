  "full_text": "ANNOUNCEMENT Fungi are potential sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds during long-term spaceflight but also could affect astronaut health through both opportunistic infections and system biofouling ( 1 ,  2 ). As part of a study characterizing fungal responses to the space environment, we report the draft genomes of 94 fungal strains that were isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), representing 10 ascomycetous and 1 basidiomycetous species. Aspergillus  species are environmental fungi and opportunistic pathogens ( 3 ).  Aspergillus unguis  is a member of the ISS microbiome ( 4 ) and produces industrially important compounds ( 5 ).  Aureobasidium pullulans  is a black fungus that was previously isolated from the ISS water filtration system ( 6 ) and Mars mission spacecraft-associated surfaces ( 7 ). Cladosporium  species are dominant fungal contaminants in indoor air ( 8 ,  9 ).  Cladosporium sphaerospermum  and  Cladosporium cladosporioides  were detected multiple time on the ISS, and their properties in microgravity were studied ( 10 ,  11 ). Fusarium veterinarium  is a recently described species within the  Fusarium oxysporum  complex, the species of which are ubiquitous in soil, are known human/plant pathogens ( 12 ), and were isolated both from surfaces and from infected  Zinnia hybrida  plants aboard the ISS ( 13 ,  14 ).  Fusarium annulatum , which has been isolated from plant and human tissues on Earth, has not been reported previously in space ( 15 ). Penicillium  species produce important bioactive compounds and can contaminate food and cause secondary infections ( 16 ). Previously detected on the ISS or Mir ( 2 ,  11 ) are  Penicillium citrinum , a common soil and indoor species ( 17 ),  Penicillium rubens , from which penicillin was isolated ( 18 ), and  Penicillium corylophilum , which is commonly found in damp buildings ( 19 ).  Penicillium palitans , which has been reported in cheese ( 20 ) and also in a wide range of habitats, including Antarctica ( 21 ), has not been reported previously in space. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa  is a ubiquitous environmental ( 22 ) and human commensal yeast and opportunistic pathogen ( 23 ) that is found in aquatic and built environments, including bathrooms and dishwashers ( 24 ,  25 ). It is the most commonly isolated yeast on the ISS ( 26 – 28 ). Sample collection and fungal isolation steps were described elsewhere ( 26 ). For five flight missions, eight surfaces aboard the ISS were sampled with moistened polyester wipes ( Table 1 ). Upon return to Earth, the wipes were agitated in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, which was concentrated using an InnovaPrep CP150 concentrating pipette, and suitable aliquots were spread onto nutrient media ( Table 1 ). Fungal isolates were restreaked on potato-dextrose agar (PDA), and genomic DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS MagBead DNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing libraries were prepared with an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit ( 29 ) and were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform with a S4 flow cell. After quality filtering and trimming with FastQC v0.11.7 ( 30 ) and fastp v0.20.0 ( 31 ), genomes were assembled using SPAdes v3.11.1 ( 32 ). Assembly quality was assessed with QUAST v5.0.2 ( 33 ). Fastp included screening for 512 adapters; otherwise, default settings were used for all steps.

PMM, permanent multipurpose module. d Reference genome was not available; average sequencing depth was calculated from  k -mer coverage. Genus-level identification was made via BLAST searches against the UNITE nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) database ( 34 ). Species identification was performed using specific loci suitable for species recognition ( Table 1 ) ( 35 ). Homology searches were performed with extracted sequences against the NCBI nucleotide database and in-house Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute databases containing reference sequences; in case of doubt, identification was confirmed by constructing phylograms. Data availability. The whole-genome sequences (WGSs) and raw data have been deposited in GenBank under BioProject accession number  PRJNA723004 . This project has also been deposited in the NASA GeneLab system ( 36 ) under project number  GLDS-400 . The version described in this paper is the first version.",
