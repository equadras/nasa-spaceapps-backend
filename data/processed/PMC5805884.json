  "full_text": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Bacillus horneckiae  strain 1P01SC T  was isolated from a spacecraft assembly clean room at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), where the Phoenix spacecraft was assembled ( 1 ). As previously reported, spores of this strain were resistant to UV 254  radiation up to 1,000 J m −2 .  Bacillus nealsonii  FO-92 T  was isolated from fall-out particles collected from a spacecraft assembly facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( 2 ). Spores of FO-92 T  have exhibited resistances to UV 254  up to 300 J m −2 , and vegetative cells and spores of this organism were resistant in up to 5% liquid H 2 O 2  ( 2 ).  Acinetobacter radioresistens  50v1 was isolated from the surface of the Mars Odyssey orbiter ( 3 ). Vegetative cells of this organism were capable of surviving a combination of stressors, including desiccation, up to 1,000 J of UV 254  radiation, and up to 0.33 mg/ml of H 2 O 2  ( 3 ).  Acinetobacter proteolyticus  strain 2P01AA was isolated from the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at KSC during the assembly of the Phoenix spacecraft ( 4 ). As reported previously, strain 2P01AA exhibited increased resistance to H 2 O 2  exposure and survival in up to 320 mM H 2 O 2  ( 5 ). Here, we report the first draft genome sequences of  B. horneckiae  type strain 1P01SC,  B. nealsonii  type strain FO-92, and two  Acinetobacter  species strains, 50v1, and 2P01AA, isolated from spacecraft hardware and associated surfaces. Strains 1P01SC T , FO-92 T , 50v1, and 2P01AA, were sequenced using a shotgun sequencing approach on the Illumina HiSeq paired-end platform. The reads were  de novo  assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench version 10.1.1, resulting in total genome sizes of 5,500,894 bp, 4,699,376 bp, 3,174,402 bp, and 4,328,804 bp, respectively. Genome statistics are given in  Table 1  for all the strains. Annotations were produced using both the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology server ( 6 ) and the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline ( 7 ,  8 ) and visualized using the SEED viewer ( 9 ).

Both strains had MutS, RecA, MutL, excinuclease ABC, beta-lactamase, and genes coding for the formation of persister cells ( 10 ). Strain FO-92 T  had a prophage-associated DNA repair protein (RecT), six genes associated with spore DNA protection, exodeoxyribonuclease III, and a peroxide stress regulator (PerR). Strain 1P01SC T  had cold shock proteins (CspD and CspA) and a heat-inducible transcriptional repressor (HrcA). Acinetobacter  strains 50v1 and 2P01AA possessed putative genes coding for persister cell formation, heat shock and cold shock responses, superoxide dismutase, rubredoxin-NAD(+) reductase, and cobalt, zinc, cadmium, and arsenic resistance ( 11 ). Strain 2P01AA had putative genes coding for heme oxygenase (HemO) and four genes coding for quorum-sensing molecules, which initiate biofilm biosynthesis and adhesion ( 12 ). Strain 50v1 had genes associated with betaine and choline uptake, which further allow for increased water retention in the cells ( 13 ), as well as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C and a DNA-binding protein (Dps), which has been shown to protect organisms from oxidative stress ( 14 ). Accession number(s). The genome sequences of all four isolates have been deposited at DDBL/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers listed in  Table 1 .",
