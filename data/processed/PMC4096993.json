  "abstract": "Why is a healthy person protected from  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infections, while individuals with cystic fibrosis or damaged epithelium are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen? In order to address this question, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host microenvironment and  P. aeruginosa . Therefore, using modeI systems that represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows recreating  in vivo  host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and other physicochemical factors affect  P. aeruginosa  pathogenesis and are thus important to mimic  in vitro . We highlight  in vitro  cell and tissue culture model systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to study the infectious disease process of  P. aeruginosa , mainly focusing on lung models, and their respective advantages and limitations. Continued improvements of  in vitro  models based on our expanding knowledge of host microenvironmental factors that participate in  P. aeruginosa  pathogenesis will help advance fundamental understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and increase the translational potential of research findings from bench to the patient’s bedside.",
