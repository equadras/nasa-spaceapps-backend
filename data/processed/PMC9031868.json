  "abstract": "During space missions, astronauts are faced with a variety of challenges that are unique to spaceflight and that have been known to cause physiological changes in humans over a period of time. Several of these changes occur at the microbiome level, a complex ensemble of microbial communities residing in various anatomic sites of the human body, with a pivotal role in regulating the health and behavior of the host. The microbiome is essential for day-to-day physiological activities, and alterations in microbiome composition and function have been linked to various human diseases. For these reasons, understanding the impact of spaceflight and space conditions on the microbiome of astronauts is important to assess significant health risks that can emerge during long-term missions and to develop countermeasures. Here, we review various conditions that are caused by long-term space exploration and discuss the role of the microbiome in promoting or ameliorating these conditions, as well as space-related factors that impact microbiome composition. The topics explored pertain to microgravity, radiation, immunity, bone health, cognitive function, gender differences and pharmacomicrobiomics. Connections are made between the trifecta of spaceflight, the host and the microbiome, and the significance of these interactions for successful long-term space missions.",

Introduction Humans have been exploring space for the last sixty-five years and, with the creation of the International Space Station, have been living and working in space continuously for the past 21 years. Astronauts endure many physiological and psychological changes while in space because of altered gravity, radiation, and confinement, to name but a few factors. While some spaceflight side effects are well known, such as bone loss [ 1 ], muscle atrophy [ 2 ], altered ocular structure [ 3 ], cognitive decline [ 4 ], fluid redistribution [ 5 ] and immune dysregulation [ 6 ], others, such as the taxonomic and functional changes of the astronaut microbiome, have been less studied, with the impact on astronaut health even less so. Understanding how the human microbiome adapts to space travel and how this influences astronaut health, pre-, post- and in-flight, is essential in reaching our goal of long-duration human exploration in low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond. This review will discuss changes in the astronaut microbiome as a result of spaceflight (and other stressors pre- and post-flight), how these changes may impact astronaut health, and the resulting consequences for long-duration spaceflight. We also provide recommendations for industry and government entities designing future manned missions to the Moon and Mars on how to incorporate microbiome data into their planning and ways in which the microbiome can be targeted or manipulated to ensure successful long-duration human exploration beyond low Earth orbit. 2. Human Microbiome Our body consists of trillions of bacteria that are on par with the number of human cells we have [ 7 ]. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) alone harbors 100 trillion bacteria, consisting of 1000 different species, 7000 strains and 3.3 million non-redundant microbial genes [ 8 , 9 , 10 ]. The skin bacterial communities on a typical hand consist of >150 species, with only 13% similarity amongst different individuals [ 11 ]. Other sites have simpler bacterial communities, like the healthy vagina, which is mainly composed of  Lactobacillus  [ 12 ]. Human breast tissue, once thought of as sterile, is now accepted as having a stable microbial population [ 13 , 14 ]. These microbial communities, found in and outside our body, are referred to as the “human microbiome”, a term first coined in 2001 by Joshua Lederberg to refer to the “ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space” [ 15 ]. These microorganisms consist of archaea, eukaryotes (fungi and protists) and viruses, with bacteria making up the majority of organisms present (99%) [ 10 ]. While the terms “human microbiome” and “human microbiota” are often used interchangeably, the latter refers to the microbial taxa associated with humans, while the former refers to the collection of microbial taxa and their genes [ 16 ]. The microbial communities that colonize various parts of our body are important in promoting health, by synthesizing vitamins the host cannot make, salvaging energy from indigestible compounds, creating a competitive environment to prevent pathogen colonization, promoting maturation and regulation of the immune system, contributing to vascular development and angiogenesis or enhancing the integrity of the epithelial barrier [ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ]. These benefits are achieved by a delicate balance of commensals, symbionts and pathobionts that collectively make up one’s microbiome. If this balance is disrupted even slightly, a breakdown in homeostasis will occur, leading to disease [ 24 ]. Microbial differences have been documented between healthy and diseased individuals with periodontitis [ 25 ], inflammatory bowel disease [ 26 ], psoriasis [ 27 ], asthma [ 28 ], bacterial vaginosis [ 29 ], colorectal cancer [ 30 ] and breast cancer [ 31 ]. These observed microbial differences are not simply a consequence of the diseased state creating an environment that selects for certain bacteria, as studies have shown that healthy animals transplanted with feces from those with obesity [ 32 ], colitis [ 33 ] and colorectal cancer [ 34 ] then go on to develop disease. Shifts in bacterial profiles not only have consequences at the site of origin but can have distal site effects as well. For example, alterations in the gut microbiota can have effects on the brain [ 35 , 36 ], liver [ 37 , 38 ], and pancreas [ 39 ], while microbial shifts in the oral cavity can be detrimental to cardiovascular health [ 40 ]. 3. Spaceflight and the Astronaut Microbiome 3.1. Spaceflight Hazards: Conditions and Challenges Facing Space Travelers Long-term spaceflight and especially deep-space exploratory missions represent an extreme environment for humans that demands adaptations to both physical and psychological stressors ( Figure 1 ) [ 41 ]. As such, a large part of spaceflight research focuses on the effects of space exposure on humans, with the aim to elucidate physiological, psychological and behavioral health risks and the necessary solutions to combat them [ 42 ]. Much of the existing knowledge about spaceflight hazards derives from crewed missions in LEO, such as those onboard the International Space Station (ISS), and analog missions on Earth. Additionally, a significant amount of data have been generated by experiments carried out in ground-based facilities, simulating different space conditions. This information, however, may provide inaccurate estimates into the risks connected to deep-space missions (outside LEO), which involve more time spent in space during a single mission than that hitherto experienced by astronauts (i.e., on average 7 months). Moreover, deep-space exploration will venture beyond the protective effects of Earth’s geomagnetic field; therefore, crewmembers on upcoming missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond will be exposed to significantly higher doses of cosmic radiation.  3.1.1. Radiation The global radiation dose for astronauts is affected by galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system, which include high atomic number and energy (HZE) ions and high-intensity solar particle events (SPEs) that produce pulses of heavy ion and energetic proton radiation [ 43 ]. It is estimated that a one-year stay on the lunar surface would result in absorbed doses for crews in the range from 100 to 120 mGy (milligray), whereas during a three-year Mars mission, transit and stay included, the values would increase to 450 mGy [ 44 ]. In comparison, the predicted doses for 6- to 12-month ISS missions range instead from roughly 30 to 120 mGy [ 44 ]. For reference, 4.5 Gy has been indicated as the LD 50  value for human cells (median lethal dose) [ 45 ]. During SPEs, astronauts may additionally be exposed to an extremely high dose of protons (i.e., up to 1 Gy or more) that could lead to acute radiation sickness (ARS) [ 46 , 47 ]. Although radiation derived from SPEs is effectively absorbed by the shielding material of a spacecraft or well-designed spacesuit, not all SPEs are predictable and can therefore pose a real threat to astronauts, especially during planetary extravehicular activity (EVA), which would take place more frequently than during a 6-month ISS stay [ 48 ].  The consequences of chronic exposure to radiation, and to CGR in particular, is concerning, due to the high energy, high penetrability and ionizing nature of their most hazardous components, the HZE particles [ 49 ]. These particles are so penetrating that shielding can only partially protect against exposure and the large emission of secondary neutrons that may follow, posing an additional hazard to the crew [ 50 ]. The types of radiation encountered in space are different from terrestrial radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, and induce distinct patterns of DNA double-strand breaks and disease outcomes, resulting in epigenetic changes and persistently high levels of oxidative damage and tissue inflammation following exposure [ 51 ]. This is relevant because of the association of oxidative stress with the etiology of several human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., altered sensory perception, neurovestibular problems, etc. [ 52 ]), gastrointestinal diseases [ 53 ], and the possible correlation between spaceflight and the onset of a number of diseases normally related to aging [ 54 ]. Exposure to space radiation, especially when considering that heavy ions are more effective per unit dose in causing solid cancer compared to gamma-rays [ 55 ], can therefore have a detrimental impact on the quality of life during and post flight. Visual disturbances appear to also be correlated to radiation exposure, as indicated by reports from past Apollo, Skylab and MIR missions where astronauts experienced flashes of light moving across their visual field, possibly due to alteration in perception caused by ionizing radiation [ 56 ]. An additional aspect to consider when assessing radiation-related risks are the non-targeted effects (NTEs) of radiation, which increase biological effectiveness for low doses of high linear energy transfer radiation (LET), such as HZE particles, and may lead to alterations in cell signaling and/or genomic instability of cell progeny [ 55 , 57 ].  3.1.2. Microgravity Along with radiation, microgravity—a condition in which the gravity level is almost zero but not neutralized—represents another major health hazard related to spaceflight. While astronauts mostly experience microgravity during spaceflight and onboard the ISS, they do experience intermediate periods of hypergravity (e.g., 3–6 G) during launch and ascent and upon descent back through the Earth’s atmosphere [ 58 ]. Additionally, various levels of altered gravity are found on other planetary bodies, such as on the Earth’s Moon—one-sixth gravity (G)—and Mars—one-third gravity (G)—(hypogravity) [ 42 ].  Spaceflight and ground-based analog experiments have shown that altered gravity, as well as the transition through various levels of gravity, subject biological systems (i.e., humans, animals, plants) to varying levels of stress with negative consequences. Specifically, microgravity can induce cellular and molecular alterations with changes to the genome, epigenome, and proteome, connected with a range of pathologies [ 42 ]. In humans, exposure to microgravity can influence several body systems such as the neurovestibular, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, bone metabolic and immune-hematological system [ 59 , 60 ]. For example, altered body fluid distribution occurs during microgravity and this headward shift of fluids, including blood, leads to a compensatory cardiovascular system change, with increased intracranial pressure, cerebrospinal pressure or inner ear fluid pressure, decreased leg volume, puffiness in the face and even long-term ocular damage [ 61 ]. According to the “fluid shift” theory, this increased pressure is the root of “space motion sickness”, a set of symptoms that impair operational performance of 60–80% of astronauts. Additional interconnected abnormalities include morphological changes in the white and grey matter of the brain following long-duration spaceflight (average of 171 days), which have been attributed to the structural neuroplasticity of the sensorimotor system, in an effort to adapt motor strategies to maintain physiological homeostasis and ensure proper behavioral output in space [ 3 ]. Lack of gravitational loading also results in muscle atrophy, especially in the lower extremities, accompanied by functional and structural alterations. While muscular loss has been linked to reduced muscular activity and hypokinesia due to limited movement inside the spacecraft, structural changes seem to be related to both a higher level of muscle protein degradation enzymes and a decrease in protein synthesis [ 59 ]. Extended exposure to microgravity also results in bone loss due to insufficient bone formation compared with bone resorption, and this reduction in bone mass and strength during spaceflight increases the risk of bone fracture, even upon return to Earth [ 62 ]. As reported for radiation, similarities have been observed between the adaptive response to microgravity in humans and aging, since both prompt the decline of almost every body system [ 5 ]. Though several phenotypic changes resemble those determined by aging under standard gravitational conditions, the magnitude and speed of some processes (bone loss, among others) is far greater (i.e., 1% loss/month) than that which is typically seen during aging. Hence, this is of critical concern when considering the effects of long-duration spaceflight [ 1 ].  3.1.3. Psychological Stressors In addition to the aforementioned stressors, several psychological and social issues have been demonstrated to affect the crew during extended separation from society in a closed and confined environment. They may include homesickness and loneliness, apathy, interpersonal stressors, and sexual attraction/tension [ 63 ]. A constricted living environment can lead to isolation, loss of spatial capacity, increased anxiety and depression, which can be accompanied by symptoms such as hallucinations, reduced consciousness and poor bodily coordination [ 64 , 65 ]. Additional psychological triggers range from external physical hazards such as space debris and vehicular malfunction to gravitational shifts and outer space radiation [ 65 ]. The ability of ionizing radiation to modulate the psycho-emotional status and, specifically, to exert an anxiogenic effect on the central nervous system was shown in rats exposed to doses related to deep-space missions [ 66 ]. In addition, diet has a critical role in both the physiological and the psychological health of space travelers. The spacecraft environment, in particular the lack of ultraviolet exposure, increased carbon dioxide levels, the spacesuit atmosphere, etc., can affect nutrition requirements for long-duration missions. Crewmembers may even experience a reduction in their food intake, dubbed “anorexia in space” which may be linked to microgravity, alterations in the circadian rhythm (continuous light environment of space missions) and “menu fatigue”, which not only affects appetite but the proper functioning of the gastrointestinal system [ 64 ]. Hence, nutritious and palatable food is necessary not only to meet nutritional requirements and avoid deficiency diseases, but also to keep astronauts psychologically healthy [ 67 ].  Excessive exposure to noise, mainly due to equipment and crew activities, may represent another stressor compromising well-being as well as sleeping patterns [ 68 ]. As a matter of fact, the duration of an astronaut’s sleep is reportedly reduced to around 6 to 6.5 h/day during missions [ 69 ]. Psychosomatic disorders (e.g., headaches, fear of illness, gastroenteric problems), consisting of distressing physical symptoms which are not fully explained by a real physical condition, have also been reported from space [ 64 ]. Similarly, post-return personality changes and psychiatric problems have been observed in space travelers [ 70 ]. Other stress factors that may arise in a multicultural crew are related to language barriers, stereotypes and cultural misunderstandings [ 67 ]. Additionally, new psychological stressors could appear in deep-space missions that were not present in missions closer to Earth, and already-known issues could be intensified, leading to stress and problematic behaviors that may interfere with a crew’s productivity and relationships [ 71 ]. For example, during a multi-year spaceflight such as that required for a mission to Mars, the crew would be confronted with no access to most of the mitigation strategies currently in place on the ISS, such as real-time communications with family and ground-based mission control and the view of Earth, that contribute to their psychological well-being [ 48 ]. Based on the “Earth-out-of-view phenomenon”, humans traveling in outer space might start feeling unconnected to Earth and to family and friends [ 72 ]. On the other hand, delays in crew–ground communication (up to 22 min on Mars) would require astronauts to operate more autonomously from mission control [ 73 ]. Furthermore, people on a Mars expedition will need to depend on local resources to generate water and fuel for the return home and thus, the psychology of this dependance is an important issue to be considered [ 70 ]. In this context, a greater likelihood of withdrawal, territorial behavior and asthenia may occur [ 74 ]. The latter is a problematic syndrome quite commonly observed during long-duration missions that produces fatigue, irritability, attention and concentration difficulties, along with heightened perceptual sensitivities, physical weakness, sleep and appetite problems, etc. [ 64 , 75 ]. 3.1.4. Additional Risk Factors  Psychological stress, circadian rhythms, and sleep are key factors strongly connected with one another, as well as with the immune system. This is especially relevant since microbial infection is another challenge facing space travelers. The isolation of opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms from spacecraft and space stations has been frequently reported [ 76 , 77 , 78 ] and several studies have demonstrated that spaceflight affects both the immune system (i.e., immune dysregulation) [ 79 ] and microbial physiology (i.e., enhanced virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotics resistance) [ 80 ], leading to increased risk of disease [ 81 ]. Additionally, the proximity of crewmembers to one another in the spacecraft can promote the spread of secondary infections [ 82 ]. Due to limited access to medical care during a mission, any possibility of infection should be prevented to ensure the health and safety of the astronauts and to maximize the success rate of the space mission [ 83 ]. Crews do not experience the aforementioned stressors independently; therefore, it is important to consider the combined effects of these space environment threats on human physiology, psychology, and performance. These stressful conditions, collectively referred to as “the space exposome” [ 6 ], may also exacerbate complex health problems in astronauts embarking on long-duration missions [ 3 ]. Space agencies have adopted a number of operational mitigations, direct and indirect countermeasures, whose aim is to lessen the clinical risks related to the physical and psychological stressors associated with space flight. These encompass strict exercise regimes, the use of devices to induce footward fluid shift (i.e., lower body negative pressure, LBNP) [ 2 ], pre-flight quarantine to reduce contact with potential pathogens [ 6 ], radiation-shielding spacesuits [ 84 ], the use of HEPA air filters and in-line water filters in the spacecraft, nutritional supplementation, vaccination, psychological support, etc. [ 6 ].  While some of the changes induced by exposure to space conditions (e.g., reduction in some motor functions) reportedly disappear shortly or a few months after the end of LEO missions [ 85 ], it should be noted that risk assessments and mitigation for lunar visit/habitation, deep-space journey/habitation and planetary missions remain uncertain [ 86 ]. If certain medical risks, such as nutrition, infection, psychological impact and even death, appear to be common to all mission profiles, other risks are actually unique to individual scenarios [ 87 ]. For instance, risks associated with lunar missions—e.g., lunar surface operations, a lunar outpost, etc.—along with radiation, microgravity and the aforementioned psychological issues, also include exposure to hazardous materials such as rocket fuel, lunar dust (regolith), micrometeorite impact damage, and extremes of temperature [ 87 ]. Similarly, perchlorates in the Martian dust would be a concern in terms of contamination of the habitats and of inha",

  "conclusion": "10. Conclusions By the end of the decade, NASA aims to establish a sustainable habitat on the Moon, followed by the next ambitious plan of human occupation on Mars. NASA, along with other space agencies, government, academia, and industry are striving to address the challenges of living in space for long periods of time. Missions to the Moon would be 1000× farther from the Earth than the International Space Station, and a mission to Mars would last at least 6 months. The 20 years of human studies conducted on the ISS have provided invaluable knowledge of how the human body adapts to the space environment, but more work is needed to understand how the human body will function and adapt to space conditions beyond LEO. One such adaptation is the human microbiome, and as discussed in this review, this plays a significant role in modulating health and disease. We have demonstrated the importance of a balanced microbiome to help maintain astronaut health in orbit and have discussed adverse events experienced by the crew during missions of varying lengths and how the microbiome (either balanced or in dysbiosis) ties into those medical events. Moreover, we have examined less well-established links between spaceflight, bone loss and the microbiome and emphasized the importance of taking into account gender differences when designing appropriate countermeasures for short- and long-term missions. In addition, we have also examined the role that the microbiome can play in altering the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals that are part of the astronaut medical toolkit in space, and the consequence of this for long-term missions. As we move forward with long-term space travel and human habitation beyond LEO, more studies will be needed that explore the astronaut microbiome, the factors governing its stability or disruption and its interaction with the host and the spacecraft environment. We hope that the literature presented in this review and the recommendations provided will help i"
