  "abstract": "Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of  ad libitum  ( ad lib ) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from  ad lib  mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support,  Ucp1  expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the  ad lib  group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient  ob/ob  and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d)  ob/ob  mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22°C), BMAT increased in  ob/ob  mice as well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased temperature. However, infusion of  ob/ob  mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is a fat depot spatially confined within the skeleton. The resident adipocytes are derived primarily from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. As reviewed ( 1 – 4 ), BMAT differs from other adipose depots in that the density and spatial distribution of adipocytes can vary dramatically within and among bones and adipocytes are interspersed among many other cell populations, including hematopoietic lineage cells. The function and regulation of BMAT is incompletely understood but has received considerable recent attention, particularly in regard to its role as a potential regulator of bone metabolism ( 5 ,  6 ). In rodents, conditions such as diet-induced obesity, chronic heavy alcohol consumption, severe caloric restriction and microgravity have been reported to result in increased BMAT. Notably, the same conditions are often associated with decreased osteoblast differentiation and/or activity, and bone loss ( 7 – 10 ). Mechanistically, some investigators have hypothesized that differentiation to adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts and/or production of adipocyte-derived adipokines lead to a negative bone turnover balance ( 11 ,  12 ). However, a negative relationship between BMAT levels and osteoblasts is far from universal ( 6 ,  13 – 15 ) and, when the relationship occurs, causality has not been established. In total, the experimental evidence to date does not strongly support a deterministic model where reducing BMAT will invariably lead to increased bone mass ( 1 ). Mice are commonly used as a mammalian model organism, in part because of their diminutive size, relatively short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation. However, skeletal adaptations do not scale linearly with body size ( 16 ). In addition to being physically small, mice are daily facultative heterotherms and have a thermoneutral zone that is much higher than in humans ( 17 ). One outcome of this difference in thermoregulation is that mice housed at room temperature (~22°C) experience cold stress. Adaptation to chronic cold stress is recognized to have profound physiological effects that influence disease processes ( 18 ,  19 ). In contrast to larger rodents and humans, male and female mice lose cancellous bone in femur and lumbar vertebra well before growth has ceased ( 20 ). We have shown that cold stress induced by room temperature housing contributes to, and may be fully responsible for, premature cancellous bone loss in mice. Additionally, cold stress in growing mice results in compartment-specific reductions in bone accrual, reduced leptin levels, and decreased accrual of BMAT ( 21 ,  22 ). There is strong circumstantial evidence that the adipokine leptin is an important negative regulator of BMAT in mice ( 23 ). Compared to C57BL/6J (B6) wild type (WT) mice, bone growth and turnover are lower and BMAT higher in long bones of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice ( 24 – 28 ). Furthermore, treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin by either intracerebroventricular or subcutaneous delivery normalizes bone growth and turnover and reduces BMAT levels ( 23 ,  25 ,  29 ,  30 ). On the other hand, there are circumstances where elevated leptin is associated with increased BMAT. For example, compared to mice housed at 22°C, housing B6 female mice at 32°C results in increases in serum leptin and BMAT ( 31 ). Additionally, high blood leptin levels in obese rodents are associated with increased BMAT ( 32 ). These discrepant findings, where higher levels of leptin can be associated with either increases or decreases in BMAT, suggest that environmental temperature has actions on BMAT that do not require leptin. To better understand the role of leptin as a potential mediator of the response of BMAT to changes in environmental temperature, we performed 2 experiments where we measured BMAT 2 weeks following transfer of mice housed at room temperature (22°C) to near thermoneutral (32°C) housing. It is challenging to house mice at true thermoneutral because the thermoneutral point differs by several degrees between the dark and light photo periods ( 33 ). However, a constant temperature of 30-32°C approximates the midrange of thermoneutrality and was shown to prevent cold stress-induced cancellous bone loss in male and female mice as well as result in increased BMAT in female mice ( 21 ). In the first experiment, we supplemented 6-week-old female B6 WT mice with leptin, administered for 2 weeks using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump, at 10 µg/d. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food consumption of leptin-supplemented mice. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 WT, leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of treatment. Materials and methods The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Experiment 1: Effects of leptin supplementation on food intake, body composition, bone and bone marrow adiposity in female B6 mice Six-week-old female B6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). We chose 6-week-old mice because this age corresponds to near peak cancellous bone volume fraction in femur in the B6 female ( 20 ). The animals were placed at 32°C upon arrival and maintained individually housed on a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle. Near thermoneutral housing was used to prevent cold stress associated with subthermoneutral housing (e.g., standard room temperature, ~22°C) ( 31 ,  34 ). The mice were randomized by weight into one of 3 treatment groups: (1) ad lib (n=16), (2) leptin-supplemented (leptin) (n=9), or (3) vehicle-treated and pair-fed to leptin (pair-fed) (n=10) ( \n Figure 1 \n ). Mouse leptin (10 µg/d, equivalent to 400 ng/h; 498-OB-05M, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle (20 mM Tris-HCL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were delivered via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps (Alzet Model 1002, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) to leptin and pair-fed mice, respectively as described ( 35 ). Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to the ad lib and leptin-supplemented mice. The pair-fed mice were calorically restricted to match food intake of the leptin-supplemented mice. These mice also served as vehicle-treated surgery controls. We did not include B6 mice housed at 22°C as an additional control because a pilot study (data not shown) revealed no change in BMAT. Food intake was recorded daily for the 2-week duration of treatment. Body weight was recorded 2 days prior to implant surgery, on day of implant surgery (only mice undergoing surgery were weighed), and on days 4, 11, and 14 (necropsy) post-surgery. Calcein was administered at 4 and 1 d prior to necropsy to label mineralizing bone. Mice were fasted overnight and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed prior to necropsy. For tissue collection death was induced by cardiac exsanguination. Abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) – perigonadal, mesenteric, perirenal, retroperitoneal – was excised and weighed. Samples of perigonadal WAT were stored in RNAlater for evaluation of gene expression. Interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) was also excised and stored in RNAlater for evaluation of gene expression. Femora were removed, fixed for 24h in 10% buffered formalin and stored in 70% ethanol for histomorphometric analysis. Tibiae were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for analysis of gene expression. Figure 1 Experimental design. Experiment 2: Effects of leptin on body composition and bone marrow adiposity in leptin-deficient ob/ob female mice Six-week-old female B6 WT mice and ob/ob mice on a B6 background were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Following arrival, the B6 WT mice were randomized by weight into one of 2 groups: (1) baseline (n=8) and (2) no treatment control (n=9) ( \n Figure 1 \n ). The ob/ob mice were randomized by weight into 3 groups: (1) baseline (n=7), (2) vehicle (n=8), or (3) leptin-treated (n=8). The baseline groups were sacrificed at the start of the experiment and treatment mice placed at 32°C. Mouse leptin (0.3 µg/d, equivalent to 12 ng/h; 498-OB-05M, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle (20 mM Tris-HCL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were delivered via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps (Alzet Model 1002, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) to leptin and vehicle mice, respectively. Infusion of leptin at 0.3 µg/d was shown to increase longitudinal bone growth and bone formation with minimal effects on hypothalamic gene expression in ob/ob mice ( 35 ). Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to all groups. We did not include mice housed at 22°C as an additional control because a pilot study (data not shown) did not reveal a change in BMAT. As in Experiment 1, percent body fat (DXA) and abdominal WAT mass (perigonadal, mesenteric, perirenal, retroperitoneal) were recorded at necropsy. In addition, interscapular BAT was removed and stored in RNA later for evaluation of gene expression and femora were removed, fixed for 24h in 10% buffered formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for histomorphometric analysis of bone marrow adiposity. Dual energy absorptiometry Total body bone mineral content (g), bone area (cm 2 ), bone mineral density (g/cm 2 ) and percent body fat were determined using DXA (PIXImus2, Lunar, Madison, WI) under isoflurane anesthesia immediately prior to necropsy. Blood measurements Serum leptin was measured using Mouse Leptin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), serum osteocalcin was measured using Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and serum Mouse C terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX-1) was measured using ELISA kit (Life Sciences Advanced Technologies, St. Petersburg, FL) according to the respective manufacturer’s protocol. Intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for all ELISA assays were within the manufactures’ reported CVs of ≤ 5%. Histomorphometry The methods used to measure static and dynamic bone histomorphometry have been described, with modifications for mice ( 36 ). In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and xylene, and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate. Longitudinal sections (4 µm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to slides precoated with 1% gelatin solution. One section/animal was mounted unstained for measurement of fluorochrome labels and marrow adipocytes using ultraviolet illumination. All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA) in the distal femur metaphysis (10x) and distal femur diaphysis (6.7x) ( \n Supplemental Figure 1 \n ). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25 – 1.1 mm proximal to the growth plate, averaged 0.92 mm 2  in area, and excluded primary spongiosa and cortical bone. The sampling site for the distal femoral diaphysis was located 2.0 – 2.7 mm proximal to the growth plate, averaged 0.63 mm 2  in area, and excluded cortical bone. Proper depth was identified by a characteristic v-shaped growth plate and parallel diaphyseal cortices approximately equal in width ( \n Supplemental Figure 1 \n ). Fluorochrome-based measurements of bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, %), 2) mineral apposition rate (the distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3-day interlabel interval, µm/d), and 3) bone formation rate (bone formation rate/bone perimeter: calculated by multiplying mineralizing perimeter by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter, μm 2 /µm/y). All bone histomorphometric data are reported using standard 2-dimensional referents and nomenclature ( 37 ). Cell-based BMAT measurements included adipocyte area fraction (adipocyte area/tissue area, %), adipocyte number (#/mm 2 ) and adipocyte size (µm 2 ). Adipocytes were identified as large circular, oval or ellipsoid-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane; adipocytes are easily detected because ultraviolet absorption by lipid storage droplets is negligible due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. These cells can be appreciated as black ‘ghosts’ surrounded by a membrane in  \n Supplemental Figure 1B \n . The size of each adipocyte was determined by outlining the cell perimeter; the OsteoMeasure software was used to calculate cell area. On average, we counted 55 adipocytes/mouse in the ROI in distal femur metaphysis and 17 adipocytes/mouse in the ROI in distal femur diaphysis. Gene expression Total RNA from BAT, WAT and tibia was isolated from 8 mice/group and individually analyzed. Whereas histomorphometry focused on a defined region of interest in femur, evaluation of gene expression included the entire tibia. Tibiae were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and further homogenized in Trizol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). BAT and WAT were directly homogenized in Trizol. Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Life Technologies). All quantitative polymerase chain (qPCR) reactions were done using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher), and relative quantification was determined using the ΔΔCt method. qPCR for BAT Ucp1 gene expression was done using primers specific for mouse Ucp1 (For: GTGAAGGTCAGAATGCAAGC, Rev: AGGGCCCCCTTCATGAGGTC) and mouse 18S ribosomal RNA (Rn18s) (For: CCGCAGCTAGGAATAATGGAAT, Rev: CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT). Data represent average fold change normalized to Rn18S. Expression levels for genes related to adipogenesis were determined for WAT and tibia using the Mouse Adipogenesis RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen). Gene expression was normalized using the averaged expression of Gapdh, Gusb, and Hsp90ab1 housekeeping genes, and relative quantification (ΔΔCt method) was determined using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software (Qiagen). Statistical analysis Experiment 1 Numerical outcome variables collected in female B6 mice that were supplemented with leptin or served as controls (ad lib-fed mice and mice pair-fed to match food consumption by leptin-supplemented mice) were compared using parametric one-factor analysis of variance or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. Group mean comparisons were made using the fitted analysis of variance linear model, Welch’s two-sample t-test, or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Experiment 2 Linear models with 5 groups (untreated B6 WT or ob/ob mice housed at 22°C, untreated B6 WT mice housed at thermoneutral temperature, and ob/ob mice receiving leptin at 0.3µg/day or a vehicle control housed at thermoneutral temperature) were used to evaluate the effects of housing temperature and leptin supplementation on BMAT. Experiments 1 and 2 Residual analysis and Levene’s test were used to assess homogeneity of variance and normality. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was made by setting the maximum false discovery rate equal to 5% ( 38 ). Differences were considered significant at false discovery rate adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as mean ± SD. Data analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2. Results Experiment 1: Effects of leptin supplementation on food intake, body composition, bone, and bone marrow adiposity in female B6 mice The effects of leptin supplementation and pair feeding on food intake, body composition, serum leptin, and Ucp1 gene expression in BAT are shown in  \n Figure 2 \n . Food intake (panel A) decreased over time in all groups; leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice consumed less food/day than ad lib-fed mice until day 7, after which food consumption did not differ among groups. Cumulative food intake (panel B) was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice. Body mass did not differ among treatment groups at any time point evaluated, including at termination of treatment (panel C). However, body mass change over the 14 days of treatment (panel D) was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice and tended (p = 0.06) to be lower in leptin-supplemented compared to pair-fed mice. Normalized body mass relative to baseline body mass was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice at all time points evaluated (panel E and F). Percent body fat (panel G) and WAT mass (panel H) were lower in leptin-supplemented mice than in ad lib or pair-fed mice. Significant differences in percent body fat or WAT mass were not detected between ad lib and pair-fed mice. Serum leptin levels (panel I) did not differ among treatment groups.

  "introduction": "Introduction Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is a fat depot spatially confined within the skeleton. The resident adipocytes are derived primarily from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. As reviewed ( 1 – 4 ), BMAT differs from other adipose depots in that the density and spatial distribution of adipocytes can vary dramatically within and among bones and adipocytes are interspersed among many other cell populations, including hematopoietic lineage cells. The function and regulation of BMAT is incompletely understood but has received considerable recent attention, particularly in regard to its role as a potential regulator of bone metabolism ( 5 ,  6 ). In rodents, conditions such as diet-induced obesity, chronic heavy alcohol consumption, severe caloric restriction and microgravity have been reported to result in increased BMAT. Notably, the same conditions are often associated with decreased osteoblast differentiation and/or activity, and bone loss ( 7 – 10 ). Mechanistically, some investigators have hypothesized that differentiation to adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts and/or production of adipocyte-derived adipokines lead to a negative bone turnover balance ( 11 ,  12 ). However, a negative relationship between BMAT levels and osteoblasts is far from universal ( 6 ,  13 – 15 ) and, when the relationship occurs, causality has not been established. In total, the experimental evidence to date does not strongly support a deterministic model where reducing BMAT will invariably lead to increased bone mass ( 1 ). Mice are commonly used as a mammalian model organism, in part because of their diminutive size, relatively short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation. However, skeletal adaptations do not scale linearly with body size ( 16 ). In addition to being physically small, mice are daily facultative heterotherms and have a thermoneutral zone that is much higher than in humans ( 17 ). One outcome of this difference in thermoregulation is that mice housed at room temperature (~22°C) experience cold stress. Adaptation to chronic cold stress is recognized to have profound physiological effects that influence disease processes ( 18 ,  19 ).

We have shown that cold stress induced by room temperature housing contributes to, and may be fully responsible for, premature cancellous bone loss in mice. Additionally, cold stress in growing mice results in compartment-specific reductions in bone accrual, reduced leptin levels, and decreased accrual of BMAT ( 21 ,  22 ). There is strong circumstantial evidence that the adipokine leptin is an important negative regulator of BMAT in mice ( 23 ). Compared to C57BL/6J (B6) wild type (WT) mice, bone growth and turnover are lower and BMAT higher in long bones of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice ( 24 – 28 ).

  "discussion": "Discussion Food consumption decreased in B6 mice following transfer from room temperature to thermoneutral housing in this and prior studies ( 21 ,  22 ). The time course for reduced food consumption was advanced (i.e., occurred earlier) but the magnitude of the decrease was not influenced by leptin supplementation. Compared to ad lib mice, supplementation of B6 mice with leptin had no effect on serum leptin levels measured at necropsy but resulted in lower BAT Ucp1 expression, lower serum CTX, lower abdominal WAT and lower BMAT in metaphysis and diaphysis of the distal femur, and higher bone formation rate in distal femur metaphysis. Pair feeding did not closely replicate the effects of leptin supplementation on B6 mice housed at thermoneutral. Transfer of ob/ob mice from room temperature to thermoneutral resulted in higher abdominal WAT and higher BMAT in distal femur. Finally, treatment of ob/ob mice with low dose leptin reduced the increase in BMAT in distal femur following transfer to thermoneutral housing but did not impact abdominal WAT weight. In the present study, we observed a reciprocal relationship between bone formation rate (increased) and BMAT levels (decreased) in distal femur of B6 mice following leptin supplementation. We and others noted inverse relationships between bone formation and BMAT at various skeletal sites during aging and in response to hypophysectomy, spaceflight, ionizing radiation, high fat diets and chronic heavy alcohol consumption ( 7 – 10 ,  14 ,  23 ,  39 – 42 ). However, as mentioned in the Introduction, a causal association between changes in BMAT levels and bone formation rate has not been demonstrated and there are numerous exceptions to this reciprocal relationship. For example, ovariectomy (ovx) in rats results in increases in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter as well as BMAT, as does increasing housing temperature of mice from room temperature to the thermoneutral range ( 43 ). Furthermore, BMAT was increased and bone formation unchanged in ovx rats following a 14-day spaceflight ( 39 ). Finally, treatment with the bone anabolic hormones fibroblast growth factor or parathyroid hormone increased bone formation in rodents without reducing BMAT ( 14 ,  44 ). It remains uncertain as to whether BMAT alters the skeletal response to regulatory factors such as hormones and mechanical loads. Compared to B6 WT mice, adult ob/ob mice have higher BMAT levels. However, hindlimb unloading resulted in cancellous bone loss and changes in bone turnover in ob/ob mice indistinguishable from the skeletal response in B6 WT mice ( 45 ). Female mice housed at thermoneutral have higher BMAT and cancellous bone mass than female mice housed at room temperature but antagonizing accrual of BMAT by treatment with the nonspecific β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol had minimal effect on bone mass, microarchitecture and turnover ( 31 ). Additionally, in spite of differences in BMAT, inflammation-induced bone loss was similar ",
