Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein “caps” at the natural ends of chromosomes essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeres face two major challenges as a result of their physical location: the inability to replicate to the very end of linear DNA molecules (the end replication problem) 1 , 2 ; and circumventing activation of inappropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) (the end protection problem) 3 , 4 . Mammalian telomeres are composed of tandem arrays of highly conserved repetitive G-rich sequence (5’-TTAGGG/CCCTAA-3’) 5 – 7 , which in humans range in length from ~5 to 15 kb and end in 3’ single-stranded G-rich overhangs of ~30–500 nucleotides 8 , 9 . The 3’ single-stranded telomeric overhang serves as the substrate for telomerase, the specialized reverse transcriptase capable of de novo addition of telomeric repeats onto newly synthesized telomeres 10 . Telomeric 3’ overhangs also facilitate formation of protective terminal structural features termed t-loops 11 , 12 . Telomeres are dynamic structures associated with a myriad of telomere-specific and nonspecific proteins, six of which comprise the shelterin complex and include the telomere-repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2, which contributes to regulation of telomerase activity, t-loop formation, and protection of chromosome ends 8 , 13 – 15 . Normal human somatic cells have very low levels of telomerase activity, and thus telomeres shorten with continued cell division, as well as with oxidative stress and a variety of lifestyle factors, including chronic stressors and environmental exposures 16 – 22 . Telomere shortening is a key molecular driver of aging and determinant of age-related degenerative pathologies, including dementias, cardiovascular disease, and cancer 23 – 25 . Telomerase activity is sufficient to maintain telomere length only in highly proliferative populations like germ-line and stem cells, and the vast majority of cancers 26 . The remaining ~10–15% of human cancers maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent, recombination- mediated Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway 27 – 29 . ALT tumors display a number of distinguishing features, including heterogeneous telomere lengths, increased frequencies of telomere sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE), ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), and extrachromosomal telomeric repeats (ETCRs) 30 – 32 . Due to their repetitive and heterochromatic nature, telomeres were long regarded as silent, rather unremarkable regions of the genome. Therefore, discovery of TElomere Repeat-containing RNA, or TERRA, propelled the field into new areas of research and potential mechanisms of telomere maintenance 33 , 34 . TERRA, a presumed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) until recently 35 , ranges in length from ~ one hundred to over 9000 nucleotides and is transcribed from CpG islands within subtelomeric regions towards chromosomal termini by RNA Pol II, predominantly using the C-rich leading-strand as a template and producing 5’-UUAGGG-3’ transcripts 33 , 36 , 37 . TERRA is thought to accumulate preferentially at short telomeres, where it contributes to end-capping structure and function via regulation of telomere length and maintenance of genome stability 38 – 40 . TERRA can also indirectly associate with telomeres via shelterin proteins 41 , 42 , as well as interact with an array of RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) 43 , 44 . In telomerase-positive human cells, TERRA is primarily chromatin-associated (bound) and not polyadenylated (polyA-), while “free” (unbound) TERRA is polyadenylated at its 3’-end (polyA+) and represents ~7% of total TERRA 33 , 36 . TERRA can associate with telomeric DNA to generate classic R-loops, which are formed by the annealing of nascent TERRA “ in-cis ” to the complementary C-rich telomere strand when it fails to be released and remains bound as a 3-stranded structure, with the G-rich telomere strand displaced and forming G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures. There is also evidence that 3-stranded telomeric R-loops can be formed by a recombinational-like mechanism, in which TERRA invades a telomeric duplex “in-trans” 45 . In either case, and similar to t-loops 46 , TERRA transcription and telomeric R-loops represent sources of replication stress and DNA damage specifically within telomeres 47 , 48 . A different TERRA-based structure occurs via the direct binding of TERRA to a C-rich single-stranded telomere tract forming a 2-stranded TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid. Telomeric R-loops and TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids promote homology-directed repair at telomeres and are common in ALT cells, likely due to an abundance of TERRA 38 . One of the hallmarks of ALT is loss of function of the chromatin remodeling complex ATRX/DAXX [α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) and its physical partner death domain-associated protein (DAXX)] 49 , which results in decompaction of telomeric chromatin 50 , thereby facilitating increased transcription and elevated levels of TERRA in ALT cells compared to normal cells or telomerase positive tumors with functional ATRX/DAXX 51 , 52 . Indeed, significantly increased frequencies of telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids were found in human U2OS ALT (osteosarcoma) cells compared to HeLa telomerase positive (cervical carcinoma) cells. Furthermore, removal of telomere-bound TERRA in ALT cells via overexpression of the endogenous RNA endonuclease RnaseH1 resulted in telomere shortening. Together, these results support critical roles for TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrids in telomere protection and recombination-mediated elongation in ALT cells 38 . Interestingly, TERRA has also been implicated in telomere mobility, a capability that would facilitate the physical telomere-telomere interaction required for recombination events to occur 38 , 53 . Such an “end-view” of TERRA is consistent with strict inhibition of DDRs at telomeres, which prevents spurious end-joining and genomic instability 54 , 55 , but also renders telomeres refractory to repair when damage does occur within and/or near telomeric regions; e.g., telomeric regions are especially susceptible to oxidative damage due to their G-rich makeup 56 , 57 . Telomere site-specific endonucleases have been developed and employed to address the question of how, and even whether, double-strand breaks (DSBs) within telomeres are repaired 58 – 60 . We previously utilized transient transfection of the well-characterized endonuclease TRAS1-EN fused to TRF1 (EN-T) targeting system 61 , 62  in human BJ1-hTERT apparently normal fibroblasts, as well as in EJ-30 telomerase positive and U2OS (ALT) cancer cells, to evaluate telomeric DSBs specifically in G1-phase of the cell cycle 63 . Telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) provided a valuable biomarker of broken telomeres, as they represent co-localization of the well-established DSB marker gamma (γ)-H2AX at telomeres 64 . Importantly, induction of telomere-specific DSBs resulted in extensive tracks of resected 5’ C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA in all cell lines (independent of telomerase status), a previously proposed biomarker of the recombination dependent ALT pathway 65 , 66 . We posited that such highly reactive and exposed DNA “ends” were protected by binding complementary TERRA and forming telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids, so that they might persist into S/G2 for recombination-mediated elongation as a means of repair. Here, to better understand the role of telomeric RNA in the telomeric DDR, we investigated TERRA associated with ionizing radiation- and telomere specific-induced damage in normal human blood in vivo (during spaceflight and high-altitude ascent of Mt. Everest), and in human U2OS (ALT) cells in vitro. Results Telomeres and TERRA in the space radiation DNA damage response We previously documented telomere length dynamics (changes over time) in astronauts experiencing long-duration spaceflight in low Earth orbit (LEO) onboard the International Space Station (ISS) 22 , 67 , 68 . Contrary to expectation based on in vitro studies and acute radiation exposures 69 , 70 , and similar to our results for NASA’s One Year Mission twin astronaut 67 , which were validated with long-read, single-molecule nanopore sequencing 7 , 22 , significantly longer telomeres (in blood) were observed during spaceflight (compared to pre-flight, baseline measures) in two unrelated 6-month mission astronauts. Furthermore, telomere length shortened rapidly upon return to Earth and, overall, average telomere length tended to be shorter after spaceflight than before for all crewmembers in our combined studies. Similarly, for the 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 all civilian crew, telomere elongation (in blood) was observed in all 4 crewmembers during the 3-day, high-elevation (590 km) orbital mission 71 , 72 . Consistent with our previous studies of astronauts living and working in the space radiation environment 22 , 73 , stress-related responses to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysregulation, inflammation, and DNA damage were also enriched during the Inspiration4 mission and correlated with telomere length dynamics 71 , 74 – 76 , thus supporting this phenotype as a consistent human response to spaceflight that is thus far independent of mission duration (3 days, 6 months, 1 year). Moreover, our previous cell-by-cell cytogenetic observations of ALT/ALT-like phenotypes during spaceflight (heterogeneous telomere lengths; very long and very short) 22 , as well as pathway analyses that implicated ALT and recombination-based maintenance of telomeres in two high altitude climbers – who also experienced telomere elongation associated with climbing Mt. Everest 68 , supported our overall supposition that due to telomeres’ particular susceptibility to oxidative damage, the ALT pathway of telomere maintenance may be transiently activated in normal cells during chronic exposure 22 . We have reported individual differences in response 68 , as well as provided support for the mechanistic role of radiation exposure underlying changes in telomere length dynamics and persistent DDRs; specifically, telomere elongation (in blood) was observed in a cohort of 15 prostate cancer patients immediately following three months of radiation therapy (IMRT) 77 , 78 . Given these results, and the emerging roles of telomeric RNA in maintaining genome stability, which include involvement in DNA damage and cellular stress responses 39 , we next interrogated whether TERRA might play a role in a low dose/low dose-rate space radiation-induced DDR. Indeed, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data provided evidence of significant increases in the abundance of TERRA transcripts (q-value < 0.05, FDR corrected) during both long and short-duration spaceflight; i.e., for the One-Year mission astronaut (Twins Study) 67 , and the Inspiration4 crewmembers (Fig.  1 ). Telomeric repeat sequence variants beyond the canonical 5’-TTAGGG-3’ have been previously reported and confirmed by a variety of approaches, including our telomere long- and short-read DNA sequencing as part of the NASA Twins Study 7 . Correspondingly, TERRA molecules have been shown to contain frequent variations in the sequence runs of perfect 5’-UUAGGG-3’ repeats 79 , which were used here to validate TERRA transcripts in both sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry (Illumina) and direct RNA-sequencing (Oxford Nanopore) platforms (short-read bulk RNA-seq, long-read direct RNA, and single-cell RNA-seq). In reads containing the telomeric RNA/TERRA canonical motif, 5’-UUAGGG-3’, the abundance of multiple motif variants increased significantly (Mann–Whitney U test, adjusted  p -value < 0.05) compared to baseline (pre-flight and twin ground control samples) in both experiments during and immediately following space flight (Supplementary Data  1 ,  2 ); among the top ten correlating variants, Pearson’s  r  was between 0.87 and 0.94 for the Inspiration4 crewmembers, and at 0.99 for the Twins Study subjects. As such, these motifs displayed concerted significant enrichment during space flight (Twins Study), and immediately post-flight (Inspiration4, R + 1 day), returning to baseline levels over the course of recovery (Fig.  1 ). Fig. 1 Telomeric RNA (TERRA) sequence motif abundance increases in response to spaceflight. Relative abundances of motifs highly correlating to the canonical TERRA motif 5´-UUAGGG-3´ in RNA-Seq data.  a  Data from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission for the four civilian astronauts (C001–C004).  b  Data from the NASA Twins Study for the one-year mission astronaut (TW) and his identical twin ground control (HR). Triangular matrices display pairwise Mann–Whitney U test  p -values (FDR-adjusted) for comparisons between the groups, with each box containing a  p -value connecting to the groups in the comparison; significance ( p  < 0.05) is indicated in red (Supplementary Data  1 ,  2 ). “L−“ indicates timepoints measured in days prior to launch, “FD” days during spaceflight, and “R+“ in days after return to Earth; prefix “GD” replaces these prefixes for the ground control subject. “Space effect” is a collective term for in-flight timepoints (FD122–334, Twins Study) and immediate post-flight timepoints (R+1, Inspiration4). Simulated microgravity did not result in similar increases in TERRA transcripts (Supplementary Fig.  1 ; Supplementary Data  3 ). In sharp contrast, ground-based simulated microgravity alone did not lead to an increased abundance of TERRA 5’-UUAGGG-3’ motifs and its variants (Mann–Whitney U  p -value = 0.21) (Supplementary Fig.  1 ; Supplementary Data  3 ). For these in vitro experiments, and to isolate the particular effect of microgravity, normal human PBMCs from two healthy donors were loaded into a rotating wall vessel (rotary cell culture system) and rotated for 25 h to simulate microgravity, and then RNA-seq was performed on test and control cultures 80 . Notably, TERRA transcripts associated with simulated microgravity were not significantly increased, and actually even decreased in likelihood. Furthermore, the abundance of TERRA-associated sequence motifs was elevated for climbers while at high altitudes (from 1400 to 5600—6400 m above sea level), and then returned to baseline levels shortly after descent (Fig.  2 , Supplementary Data  4 ). Thus, in addition to telomere elongation and evidence of ALT-like activity in the ground-based climbers during a 5-day expedition ascending Mt Everest 68 , TERRA transcripts were significantly enriched in vivo in a high-altitude, higher-radiation environment, independent of microgravity. Fig. 2 Telomeric RNA (TERRA) sequence motif abundance increases in Earth-based high-altitude climbers of Mt. Everest. Relative abundances of motifs highly correlating to the canonical TERRA motif 5´-UUAGGG-3´ in RNA-Seq data from a longitudinal study of two male climbers of Mt. Everest (1, 2) who experienced telomere elongation and evidence of ALT-like activity during the expedition. Triangular matrices display pairwise Mann–Whitney U test  p -values (FDR-adjusted) for comparisons between the groups, with each box containing a  p -value connecting to the groups in the comparison; significance ( p  < 0.05) is indicated in red (Supplementary Data  4 ). Results demonstrate TERRA overexpression at high altitudes (EB, CII) compared to lower altitudes (CO, NP) in this somewhat similar stressful and high-altitude extreme environment, independent of microgravity. TERRA in the DNA damage response to ionizing radiation-induced DSBs To evaluate whether TERRA might be involved in a general radiation response, another major stressor associated with spaceflight (and high altitudes), cycling human U2OS (ALT) cells with high levels of TERRA were exposed to ionizing radiation (IR), a DNA damaging agent and potent inducer of prompt DSBs throughout the genome; specifically, cells were exposed to γ-rays (2 Gy), or sham-irradiated (0 Gy), and incubated for 4 h. High-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) cell-by-cell image analyses and quantification 81  of TERRA signals in individual interphase nuclei following RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) revealed a significant increase in the mean number of TERRA foci/cell in irradiated cells compared to unirradiated controls ( p  ≤ 0.0001) (Fig.  3a ). To validate and confirm that signals were indeed TERRA, irradiated and unirradiated U2OS cells were treated with RNaseA, which degrades free RNA, and although reduced, TERRA signals remained. Therefore, for all experiments, cells were treated with a combination of RNaseA+H to remove both bound (DNA:RNA hybrids) and unbound (free) TERRA 82 , which significantly reduced the number of TERRA foci observed ( p  < 0.01; Supplementary Fig.  2a , Supplementary Data  5 ). Resistant (remaining) TERRA foci following RNaseA+H treatment likely represent TERRA nested in unwinding RNA G4 structures 83 . These results provide orthogonal validation that TERRA abundance increases in response to acute IR exposure and genome-wide induction of DSBs. Fig. 3 Transcription-dependent TERRA foci increase in response to IR-induced DNA damage/DSBs. a  Human U2OS cell populations were exposed to γ-rays (2 Gy) or sham-irradiated (0 Gy) and TERRA foci/cell quantified using 3-D image analyses following RNA-FISH. Quantification of the mean number of TERRA foci/cell revealed a significant increase post IR exposure (4 h) compared to unirradiated controls (DMSO). Inhibition of transcription via treatment with ActD for 3 and 8 h prior to IR exposure prevented the radiation-induced increase of TERRA foci. Error bars are SEM. Significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. **** p  < 0.0001.  b \n TERRA colocalizes at telomere-specific DSBs . Human U2OS cell populations were transiently transfected with EN-T, TRF1-only (positive control), empty vector (EV), or they remained untransfected (UT). Quantification of mean number of colocalized foci/cell: Telomere (TRF2)-TERRA foci represent TERRA at undamaged telomeres (background); Telomere-FLAG foci represent transfected/damaged telomeres without TERRA; and Telomere-FLAG-TERRA foci represent colocalization of TERRA at damaged telomeres. Error bars are SEM. Significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. **** p  < 0.0001, ns not statistically significant. See Supplementary Data  5  for all comparison statistics. To confirm that TERRA induction following in vitro IR exposure was due to increased transcription, consistent with the increased levels of TERRA transcripts observed in vivo (during spaceflight and high-altitude climb) (Figs.  1  and  2 ), global transcription was inhibited via treatment with Actinomycin-D (ActD; 10 ug/ml, diluted in DMSO) for 3, 6, 8, and 24 h, and then RNA decay measured using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to assess absolute change in expression of two housekeeping control genes (GAPDH and 18S rRNA), as per previous reports 33 , 34 , 43 , 84  (Fig.  3a , Supplementary Fig.  2b ). The timepoint for maximum reduction (% expression) was established at 3–8 h ActD treatment (53.2% vs. 39.8% and 37.4% at 8 and 24 h, respectively), therefore U2OS cells were treated with ActD (or DMSO for controls) for 3 and 8 h prior to radiation exposure (2 Gy) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy), and then fixed 4 h later for RNA-FISH. Quantification of TERRA signals (as above) demonstrated that inhibition of transcription prior to IR exposure prevented TERRA induction; i.e., cells treated with ActD did not show a radiation-induced increase of TERRA foci above background levels (Fig.  3a ). Taken together, these results support upregulation of TERRA transcription, specifically in response to IR-induced DNA damage/DSBs, as inhibition of transcription following IR exposure prevented induction of increased numbers of TERRA foci.

  "methods": "Methods RNA-Seq for astronauts Sample collection methods for the four SpaceX Inspiration4 civilian crewmembers have been detailed in full 71 , 108 . Briefly, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from K2 EDTA tubes using Ficoll separation. Single-nuclei libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the NASA Twins Study subjects, sample collection (and unavoidable loss of some samples), and poly(A) + RNA preparation was as described in Garrett-Bakelman et al.  67 , and for the high-altitude climbers as in Luxton et al.  68 . Simulated microgravity experiments De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from 2 healthy human donors between the ages of 25 and 36 from the Stanford University Blood Center (IRB eProtocol# 13942). PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method. Cells were counted and re-suspended in complete media at 1 × 10 6  cells/ml (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2mM L-Glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential Amino acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES). The cell suspension of PBMCs was loaded into 10 ml disposable rotating wall vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX) and rotated at 15 rpm for 25 hr to generate simulated microgravity. For the 1 G control, the cell suspension was plated in standard 6-well culture plates. 1 G and simulated microgravity cultures were simultaneously placed in the same 37 °C, 5% CO 2  incubator. For single-cell RNA sequencing, 1 × 10 4  PBMCs from each condition were counted and loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller, and the libraries were prepared using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent TapeStation 4200, and test-sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550. The full sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by SeqMatic (Fremont, CA). FASTQ (raw data) files were processed through 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v6.1.2 pipeline and all bases with quality below Q20 were truncated. The “cellranger count” function was used to perform transcriptome alignment, filtering, and UMI counting, and then to generate the count matrixes. Alignment was done against the human genome GRCh38-2020-A. In vitro ionizing radiation experiments U2OS cells were seeded into 4-well chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek II 154526) at a density of 5×10 5  cells/well and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2  to allow cell attachment. Cells were either sham-irradiated (0 Gy) or exposed to  137 Cs γ-rays (2 Gy) while rotating in a Mark I irradiator (J.L Sheppard) located at Colorado State University.

  "discussion": "Discussion In light of TERRA’s emerging roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses 39 , we speculated that TERRA might play a role in ionizing radiation and/or telomeric DDRs. To test this, we investigated telomeric RNA, or TERRA, levels in astronauts experiencing the low dose/low dose-rate space radiation environment and in ground-based high-altitude climbers of Mt. Everest (normal human blood in vivo), as well as in normal human PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity, and in human U2OS (ALT) cells utilizing in vitro radiation exposures and the chimeric EN-T telomeric DSB targeting system 62 , 63 , 68 . As part of the NASA Twins Study, we pioneered a variety of spaceflight-specific approaches for overcoming the unique challenges associated with obtaining astronaut/human in vivo samples for modern “omics”-based and molecular analyses. Here, transcriptomics revealed an increased abundance of TERRA transcripts in bulk cDNA, single-cell cDNA, and direct RNAseq data, during both long (One Year) and short-duration (3-day) spaceflight as compared to pre-flight ground controls. The presence of variants of the canonical TERRA motif (5’-UUAGGG-3’) in the telomeric RNA likely represent the contribution of previously reported non-canonical telomeric motifs 7 , and motifs with high levels of correlation to 5’-UUAGGG-3’ served as proxies for detection of TERRA. This was particularly evident in the case of our Twins Study data, where the top ten motifs correlated nearly perfectly (Pearson’s  r  = 0.99). We note that the counts of shorter  k -mers may be partially contributed to by the counts of longer  k -mers (such as UUAGGG explaining UUAGG). However, these motifs are often subsets of sequence, and the results are significant per-motif or across all sequences. The lower values of  r  in the Inspiration4 data may be the result of higher levels of RNA degradation or the shorter mission duration – nevertheless, these data also showed that all top motifs were significantly enriched following spaceflight, consistent with the higher levels of TERRA detected by the plurality of methods employed. It is also worth noting the much higher radiation dose-rate for the Inspiration4 high-elevation orbital mission (1.57 mSv/day) vs. the One Year Mission in LEO for the NASA Twins Study (0.42 mSv/day), potentially suggestive of a dose response in terms of TERRA expression 71 , 93 , and an important avenue of investigation for future missions. Mechanistically insightful was the observation that simulated microgravity alone did not induce similar increases in TERRA abundance. Although terrestrial analogs like rotating wall vessels or random positioning machines may not precisely replicate microgravity conditions in space, they are often used for such purposes as a proxy 94 , since they are the only reasonable or available option, and they facilitate testing the isolated effect of this single stressor.
