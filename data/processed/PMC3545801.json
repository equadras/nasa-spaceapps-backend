  "abstract": "The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 Â°C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO 2 -enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus  Carnobacterium , most closely related to  C. inhibens  (five isolates) and  C. viridans  (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of  Carnobacterium  ( C. alterfunditum ,  C. divergens ,  C. funditum ,  C. gallinarum ,  C. inhibens ,  C. maltaromaticum ,  C. mobile ,  C. pleistocenium , and  C. viridans ) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.",
