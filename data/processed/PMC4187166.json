  "abstract": "Spaceflight imposes several unique stresses on biological life that together can have a profound impact on the homeostasis between eukaryotes and their associated microbes. One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations.

Whether it is the reduction in gravity, increased exposure to low dose radiation, chronic elevated CO 2  levels or time dislocation, the physical factors associated with the spaceflight environment presents a unique set of stresses on biological systems. Of these physical factors, the reduction in gravity, or microgravity, is one of the most widely studied [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Gravity represents one of the most constant evolutionary drivers of life on Earth [ 8 , 9 ], and understanding how organisms respond to the absence of this ever-present force not only provides information on how gravity has shaped life on Earth, but also provides key insight into potential mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of microgravity during spaceflight. The large-scale physiological effects of microgravity-induced stress on animals and plants are relatively well known. For example, in humans, microgravity conditions result in bone loss, upwards to 3% per month [ 4 , 10 , 11 ], permutations to both the adaptive and innate immune systems [ 12 ], and an increased potential risk of bacterial and viral infections [ 13 , 14 ]. Plants also have an increased susceptibility to pathogenic colonization in microgravity [ 15 ], as well as altered rates of cell division, changes in morphological structures of cell tissues, such as root hairs, and induced chromosomal aberrations [ 16 , 17 , 18 ]. Although these overarching phenotypes associated with microgravity exposure have been observed for decades, ascertaining whether the phenotypes are specific to microgravity or other environmental variables, as well as the underlying etiology of these effects at the cellular and biomolecular level are not yet fully delineated. Compounding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these physiological effects is the relatively unknown impact of microgravity on the microbiome associated with eukaryotic organisms. A microbiome is typically defined as the sum of the microbes, genomes and community interactions that occur in a particular environment. The term was first applied to humans to understand the ecology of those microbes that interact with the body [ 19 ] but has been quickly adopted to represent a holistic approach to understanding the connectivity and interactions within any complex host-microbe association [ 20 ]. In humans, the recent human microbiome sequencing project has revealed that the collective metagenome of those microbes that associate with humans dwarfs the size of the human genome and contains a consortia of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses, the specific contributions of which are not yet fully delineated ( Figure 1 ) [ 21 ]. Initial surveys indicate that for every one human gene there are approximately 360 bacterial genes, thereby providing humans with millions of genes of additional metabolisms and cellular activities [ 22 , 23 ]. Over the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in our understanding of the importance the microbiome plays in maintaining plant and animal health [ 22 , 24 ]. Aspects previously attributed to the host are now recognized as being the result of interactions with microbes [ 22 , 25 , 26 ]. For example, analyses of germ-free and normally colonized mice have shown that the gut microbiota is responsible for most of the metabolites found in mammalian blood [ 27 ]. Additionally, some species of bacteria within human gut have been recently correlated to the onset of several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Type 1 diabetes [ 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ]; colorectal cancers [ 32 ]; and obesity [ 33 ] suggesting that perturbations to the gut environment (e.g., antibiotic treatments) can increase the potential risk of disease. However, in many of these same cases, modulations of the gut microbiota and probiotic therapies have been shown to attenuate the condition and treat the host organism [ 24 ]. Figure 1 Overview of the complexity of human microbiome. Circle size reflects the approximate relative abundance of the various microbes known to associate with humans. Relative gene abundance is derived from the human microbiome sequencing project [ 19 , 22 ]. Question marks reflect uncertainty or potential underestimation of gene abundance. Together, these studies indicate that stable diverse microbial communities and functional gene redundancies can provide resiliency to the host’s microbiota to withstand temporary community disturbances and potentially resist invasion by exogenous pathogenic microbes [ 24 , 34 ]. However, continuous or regular perturbations to the environment, such as exposure to microgravity, may result in loss of biodiversity or extirpation ( i.e. , the extinction of a species in localized areas of the microbiome), potentially driving the community towards disease. Although the short- and long-term resilience ( i.e. , susceptibility of community to disturbances or extirpation) of animal and plant microbiomes in response to microgravity is virtually unknown, microbial exchange and transfers do occur between microbiomes during spaceflight [ 35 , 36 ] and there is increasing evidence that microgravity induces physiological and developmental changes within specific host-microbe interactions as discussed below. Assessing the impact of microgravity on a host organism and its microbiota requires a comprehensive analysis that includes the study of both pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria as cultures and  in situ  to fully understand the requirements needed to maintain host health in the space flight environment. 2. Spaceflight and Simulated Microgravity Environments Experimentally testing the effects of microgravity on host-microbe interactions at the cellular and biomolecular level often requires a two-pronged approach. First, in ideal situations the impact of microgravity on both host and symbiont physiology can be investigated under a high-quality microgravity (10 −6  g) environment, such the International Space Station U.S. National Laboratory [ 5 , 37 ]. However, logistics with regard to access to the station, astronaut time, the need for specialized equipment and overall costs can impose limitations on experimental design and reproducibility. A second approach to microgravity research has been the development of Earth-based systems to simulate or model the microgravity environment. Examples include drop towers at various NASA facilities, and parabola flights in aircraft (e.g., Zero-G), which can provide several seconds of microgravity, albeit at a lower quality (10 −3  g). A new frontier in microgravity research is the emergence of numerous commercial suborbital companies such as Virgin Galactic, XCOR Aerospace, Blue Origin, and Masten Space Systems that in the next few years will offer lower flight cost, and more frequent and rapid flights rates for microgravity research. Although these alternative approaches may provide up to several minutes of microgravity exposure, other ground-based tools have emerged over the past few decades that can model the low-shear, low-turbulent effects of microgravity over longer periods of time and will be discussed in this review. Two of these technologies, the clinostat and rotating wall vessel (RWV), provide a relatively low cost approach to investigate the cumulative effects of microgravity on both pathogenic and mutualistic microbes [ 1 , 4 , 13 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 ]. Both technologies facilitate constant rotation that is perpendicular to the gravitational vector thus maintaining the cell cultures in a low shear suspension where the hydrodynamic forces offset gravitational settling, thus enabling the organism to be in a simulated microgravity state [ 1 , 39 ]. Rotating bioreactors can effectively replicate the low shear environments of many parts of the human body where bacteria typically associate, such as the brush-border of epithelial cells, one of the most common sites for host-microbe interactions in animals [ 42 , 43 ]. Although initially the reactors were used for bacterial suspensions, the technology has been successfully adapted to examine more complex aspects of host-microbe interactions. For example, the RWV bioreactors have been used to stimulate the formation of three-dimensional eukaryotic cell cultures that more realistically approximate the function and cellular tissue structure an exogenous microbe might encounter. More recently, RWV bioreactors have been used to look at the impact of microgravity on the colonization of host tissues  in situ , where both the host and symbiotic partners are co-incubated within the rotating vessels [ 41 , 44 , 45 ]. Although the shear forces increase when working with larger organisms in the RWV bioreactors, previous modeling experiments have shown that the fluid shear levels of objects up to 3 mm mimic those typically seen by microbes when they associate with host tissues [ 46 , 47 ]. 3. Impact of Microgravity on Animal-Microbe Associations 3.1. Pathogenic Interactions with Animals Over the past few decades, numerous studies have examined the effects of both natural and modeled microgravity on pathogenic microbes revealing several pronounced physiological responses [ 1 , 7 , 37 , 40 , 44 , 48 , 49 ]. These microgravity-induced changes include: changes in growth rate and higher cell densities; increased membrane integrity [ 7 , 45 , 50 , 51 ]; differential secondary metabolite production [ 52 ]; elevated transfer rates of genetic material between cells [ 53 , 54 ] and increased biofilm formation [ 5 , 6 , 55 , 56 ]. In addition to these basic physiological responses, several well-characterized pathogenic microbes have also exhibited changes at the molecular level by altering expression of genes known to be associated with virulence in microgravity including:  Salmonella enterica  serovar Typhimurium cultures;  Escherichia coli ; and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  [ 5 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 ]. In  S. typhimurium  cultures grown in both space flight and ground-based analog microgravity environments, there was faster colonization of mouse spleen and liver tissues and shortened time-to-death rates [ 5 , 57 ]. This enhanced pathogenicity in  S. typhimurium  has also been correlated to the overall fitness of the cultures in microgravity, including increased resistance to antibiotics, pH, temperature and osmotic stresses [ 1 , 3 , 37 , 55 ]. Transcriptional and proteomic analysis of microgravity-exposed  S. typhimurium  has revealed the differential expression of numerous genes and proteins associated with stress responses and virulence, such as lipopolysaccharide synthesis enzymes, cell invasion genes, and the global regulator Hfq [ 5 , 61 , 62 ]. Hfq, a RNA binding protein known to have a diverse role in bacterial physiology [ 63 ], has been shown to be essential for  S. typhimurium  virulence [ 64 ] as well as numerous other pathogenic microbes [ 59 , 62 , 65 , 66 ]. Of the many genes associated with microgravity exposure, the global Hfq regulator was one of the few differentially expressed genes to be identified in other pathogenic species, such as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and  Staphylococcus aureus  [ 5 , 59 , 62 ], suggesting it plays a diverse and critical role in mediating the microgravity response in bacteria. Although  S. typhimurium  clearly exhibited increased virulence in both natural and modeled microgravity, the response was environment-dependent [ 49 ]. Altering the inorganic salt concentration of the surrounding media effectively inhibited the enhanced virulence [ 49 ] suggesting that it may be possible to mitigate aspects of pathogenicity during space flight. Additionally, recent examination of the ability of several clinical pathogens to infect an animal host  in situ , where both organisms were maintained under both space flight and modeled microgravity conditions, showed an overall decrease in virulence [ 44 ]. In this study, four diverse pathogens including:  Listeria monocytogens , a common food-borne pathogen;  Staphylococcus aureus , associated with skin and respiratory infections;  Enterococcus faecalis , a prevalent antibiotic resistant species associated with gastrointestinal track; and  Candida albicans,  a fungus known to associate with skin and mucus membranes, were incubated with the nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans  for up to 48 h and then the host was assessed for viability. The overall decrease in virulence may be the result of basic morphological ( i.e. , coccoid  versus  filamentous) or motility differences between the microbial ecotypes that alter the low-shear environment of space flight, thus impacting the ability of the pathogen to colonize and infect host tissues [ 67 ]. These results may also simply reflect host-specific or even tissue-specific differential gene expression in response to various pathogens under microgravity conditions. Such studies reinforce the need to fully assess the environmental or community characteristics that predispose or drive host-microbe interactions towards disease. 3.2. Mutualistic Interactions with Animals Although disease-causing microbes represent a potential risk to astronauts in microgravity conditions, it is also essential to have a corresponding understanding of mutualistic microbes to learn what drives microbial fitness in the spaceflight environment and how to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans and their microbiome. To address these issues, one model system has recently emerged to assess the interactions between animal cells and beneficial microbes  in situ  under microgravity conditions ( Figure 2 ). The binary symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid  Euprymna scolopes  and its luminescent partner  Vibrio fischeri  was established over two decades ago as a tractable model for examining beneficial animal-microbe interactions [ 68 , 69 ]. Figure 2 Impact of microgravity on the developmental time line of mutualistic symbiosis between the squid  Euprymna scolopes  and bacterial partner  Vibrio fischeri . ( A ) Juvenile squid just after hatching. Blue rectangle marks the location within the host mantle cavity of light organ, the site of symbiosis.

( E ) Image of one half of light organ depicting the loss of the superficial epithelial appendage structures 96 h after colonization with  V. fischeri . Bar, 30 µm. ( F ) Exposure to microgravity alters the developmental time line of the symbiosis under normal gravity and modeled microgravity conditions using a RWV bioreactor. Events listed in black do not change under microgravity conditions. Those events in red are delayed during modeled microgravity, where as those events in green are accelerated. The site of symbiosis occurs in the host light organ, located within the squid’s mantle cavity ( Figure 2 A). The light organ contains a series of superficial invaginations that form long ciliated ducts, which terminate into a series of epithelial lined crypt spaces where the bacteria eventually reside and grow. On the surface of the light organ is a superficial field of epithelial cells overlaying a blood sinus that form two appendage-like structures and are critical for facilitating the initiation of the symbiosis ( Figure 2 B). Studies have revealed that the colonization and maintenance of the light organ symbiosis is highly specific and requires a complex exchange of signaling molecules and cell–cell communication that is in part mediated by the host immune system [ 70 , 71 ]. One of the initial signals involved in establishing the symbiosis is the use of micro-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and peptidoglycan. Originally characterized in pathogenic associations, LPS and peptidoglycan have been recently shown to be critical for maintaining gut homeostasis in mammals and insects [ 25 , 72 ]. The squid–vibrio symbiosis is initiated when upon hatching from their egg case the squid is exposed to bacteria-rich seawater. Peptidoglycan that is shed from these surrounding microbes induces mucus to be secreted by the surface epithelial appendage cells of the host light organ. The accumulation of mucus selectively enriches  V. fischeri  from the other surrounding microbes and within 2–3 h after hatching the  V. fischeri  begins to colonize the light organ by entering pores on the surface of the light organ then migrating through ducts until they reach the crypt spaces. During the colonization of the light organ, the bacteria induce a series of developmental events in the host squid that eventually results in a remodeling of the host light organ structure. One of the first symbiont-induced phenotypes in the host squid is the activation of the host’s innate immune response [ 69 , 71 , 73 ]. With two hours of exposure to  V. fischeri  cells, host-derived hemocytes, a macrophage-like cell, are trafficked into the blood sinus of the superficial epithelial cell appendage ( Figure 2 C). The precise role these host immune cells play in the symbiosis is not well defined, however, it is thought they facilitate the regression of superficial epithelial cells once colonization has been initiated [ 69 ]. The regression event is triggered by a bacteria-induced apoptosis event by the synergistic activity of the bacterial MAMP molecules LPS and a derivative of peptidoglycan, tracheal cytotoxin ( Figure 2 D) [ 74 , 75 ]. The apoptosis event peaks 16 h after exposure to the  V. fischeri  MAMPS and regression of the epithelial appendages is visible by 24 h and takes approximately 96 h for complete regression ( Figure 2 E) [ 76 , 77 , 78 ]. In modeled microgravity conditions, where both partners are co-incubated using RWV bioreactors, the bacteria-induced developmental time line in the host light organ is altered ( Figure 2 F). One of the first observed differences is that the trafficking of host-derived hemocytes into the light organ blood sinus, which normally occurs within two hours of bacteria exposure, is delayed until 12 h in modeled microgravity [ 41 ]. The cause for the delay is not known, but the amount of hemocyte cells in the blood sinus is significantly lower than in gravity controls suggesting that the low-shear, modeled microgravity environment suppresses the activation and transport of hemocytes to the light organ [ 41 ]. One potential explanation is that the squid hemocytes proliferation or cytokine signaling may be reduced in microgravity-like conditions. Similar results have been seen in mammalian immune systems during space flight [ 79 , 80 ]. Another key phenotype that changes in the squid–vibrio system during modeled microgravity is the acceleration of the light organ morphogenesis; specifically, the LPS-induced apoptotic cell death event throughout the superficial field of epithelial cells. Normally, the LPS triggered apoptosis event peaks approximately 16 h after bacterial exposure, however, in modeled microgravity it occurs around 8 h after exposure [ 41 ]. The epithelial cells comprising this structure appear to have an increased sensitivity to extracellular LPS in modeled microgravity conditions, although the mechanism is not fully understood [ 45 ]. The acceleration of the LPS-induced apoptosis event may be tied to the global regulator Hfq, which similar to  S. typhimurium  and  P. aeruginosa  is down regulated in  V. fischeri  during modeled microgravity conditions [ 45 ]. Additionally, mutants defective in the  hfq  gene exhibited atte",
