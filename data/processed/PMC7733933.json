  "abstract": "Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated  Pleopeltis polypodioides  fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (F t ) and quantum yield (Q y ) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Q y  when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Heat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, yield, and productivity ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Temperatures beyond the “physiological capacity” of plants have debilitating effects on biochemical processes, cellular homeostasis ( Kotak et al., 2007 ), changes in enzyme activities, photosynthesis ( Greer, 2015 ), protein synthesis ( Ferguson et al., 1994 ), and membrane fluidity ( Hemantaranjan et al., 2014 ). Damage to photosystem (PS) II and associated proteins ( Chen et al., 2018 ) is reported to be a primary target of high temperature stress ( Wen et al., 2005 ;  Mathur et al., 2014 ). Heat stress uncouples electron transport activity, ATP synthesis and variable (F v ), and maximum (F m ) chlorophyll fluorescence ( Maxwell and Johnson, 2000 ), which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, all of which induce oxidative stress ( Hasanuzzaman et al., 2013 ;  Awasthi et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, heat stress affects activity of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and low molecular weight antioxidants like ascorbic acid and glutathione (GSH), which change in response to heat stress ( Lu et al., 2008 ;  Ergin et al., 2016 ). Plants not only experience heat- but also desiccation stress, which stems from loss of water via evapotranspiration. Distinguishing combined stresses is difficult because many of the physiological and molecular responses between these stresses overlap ( Zandalinas et al., 2018 ). Some studies suggest that the combination of these two stresses is more deleterious to plant growth and productivity than each individual stress ( Jiang and Huang, 2001 ;  Rizhsky et al., 2002 ;  Lipiec et al., 2013 ;  Zandalinas et al., 2018 ) and the response to combined stresses cannot be extrapolated from the individual stress ( Zandalinas et al., 2018 ). Therefore, studies typically report the combined effects of heat and drought stress ( Rizhsky et al., 2002 ;  Bhardwaj et al., 2015 ;  Zandalinas et al., 2018 ). However, this approach obscures the individual stress response. Additionally, separating heat from desiccation stress is not possible in the field and difficult to establish even under laboratory conditions but leads to meaningful characterization of the metabolic response to individual stressors. Plants that are especially well-suited to study desiccation stress are “resurrection” plants. These plants are defined by their vegetative tissues being able to sustain desiccation to water potentials as low as −100 MPa ( Gaff, 1997 ). They can reach complete air dryness and rehydrate without suffering noticeable injury. Because these plants can sustain desiccation and attain certain levels of quiescence during this process, their heat tolerance can be tested in dry and hydrated conditions. A large body of research has reported thermotolerance capacity of non-vascular, poikilohydric species such as bryophytes ( Lange, 1955 ;  Nörr, 1974 ;  Meyer and Santarius, 1998 ) and lichens ( Lange, 1953 ;  Tegler and Kershaw, 1981 ). Although thermo and frost resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes ( Kappen, 1964 ) and heat resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes ( Eickmeier, 1986 ) and angiosperms ( Hambler, 1961 ;  Kappen, 1966 ;  Vieweg and Ziegler, 1969 ) was examined, there is no information on biochemical responses of these plants to elevated temperatures. Based on morphological and photosynthetic responses, there is general consensus that non-vascular and vascular plants show increased thermotolerance after desiccation ( Macfarlane and Kershaw, 1978 ;  Tegler and Kershaw, 1981 ;  Eickmeier, 1986 ). However, the dependency on seasonal conditions also indicates that desiccation alone is insufficient to establish thermotolerance. To dissect the biochemical responses to heat and desiccation, we studied the response of the desiccation tolerant fern  Pleopletis polypodioides  in dry and hydrated fronds. Because pteridophytes are widely distributed and successfully established in various environments, they not only provide essential information on the evolution of desiccation tolerance but also serve an excellent model to study the effects of heat stress. Pleopeltis polypodioides  (aka resurrection fern) can tolerate loss of 95% of cellular water content and regain full metabolic activities within a few hours of rehydration ( Pessin, 1924 ;  Stuart, 1968 ;  John and Hasenstein, 2017 ). In response to dehydration, the ventral surface curls inward and the dorsal surface, covered with peltate scales, remains exposed ( Pessin, 1924 ). Such folding mechanisms, also demonstrated by other resurrection plants, are thought to be a defensive mechanism against photooxidation ( Farrant et al., 1999 ;  Helseth and Fischer, 2005 ). Although there is plenty of information on morphological changes of plants in response to heat and desiccation stress, adaptations of ferns to desiccation ( Pessin, 1924 ;  Stuart, 1968 ;  Helseth and Fischer, 2005 ;  John and Hasenstein, 2017 ), and biochemical response to drought ( Maslenkova and Homann, 2000 ;  Georgieva and Maslenkova, 2001 ;  Layton et al., 2010 ;  John and Hasenstein, 2018 ) are limited. In addition, the response of Pleopeltis to heat has not been investigated. We evaluate the biochemical responses of dry and hydrated fronds of Pleopeltis to heat by assessing their photosynthetic and metabolic activities, levels of stress molecules, activities of antioxidative enzymes, membrane stability, and the fatty acid profile. Our results indicate that independent of hydration, oxidative and antioxidative systems are sensitive to heat but dried fronds tolerate heat better than hydrated fronds. Materials and Methods Plant Materials Because Pleopeltis fronds are highly responsive to environmental conditions and are efficient in water uptake compared to plants with intact rhizomes ( John and Hasenstein, 2017 ), we focused on studying the thermal tolerance of isolated fronds. Hydrated fronds  P. polypodioides  were collected from live oak ( Quercus virginiana ) trees on the campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (30.21 N, −92.02 W). All fronds were collected after a rain event during March to May from 2016 to 2019 and prior to experimentation maintained in a humid chamber at high RH. All fronds were between 4.5 and 5 cm long. The outline of the workflow is illustrated in  Figure 1  and individual methodologies explained below. FIGURE 1 Summary of the workflow of experiments and analyses performed on dried, rehydrated, and submersed Pleopeltis fronds. Data obtained from the initial sample status (red boxes) served a reference for all other treatments. Heat Treatment Heat treatment was applied for 24 h in darkness. Assays of heat treated dry and hydrated (fully and partly submersed) samples were compared with 25°C dry and fresh control, respectively. Dehydrated Fronds Detached, fresh fronds were dried at 25°C for 72 h, which reduces the RWC to < 5% ( John and Hasenstein, 2018 ). After drying, the fronds were exposed to temperatures between 30 and 50°C for 24 h in an incubator. Relative humidity decreased as a function of temperature increase. Hydrated Fronds Detached fresh fronds were placed in DI water in 20 mL glass vials such that either the entire frond (vial filled with 20 mL water) or just the apical end (4 mL water) was submersed and exposed to the same temperature as dried fronds. The reason for different levels of submersion was to test the effect of oxygen deprivation in fronds that were fully submersed compared to 100% humidity. The data were compared with hydrated fronds (without immersion) at 25°C. Photosynthetic Performance The photosynthetic performance of the fronds before and after heat stress and after re-hydration was assessed by measuring the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (F 0 , which is equivalent to F t  if the leaf sample is dark-adapted) and quantum yield (Q y ) using a FluorPen FP100 (Photo Systems Instruments, Czechia). F 0  was measured by applying a light pulse (455 nm of 0.09 μmoles m –2 s –1  for 30 μs) and recorded as F t . Similarly, Q y  measurements were obtained by applying a saturating light that measures maximum value of fluorescence (F m ) from PS II (approximately 3000 μmol m –2  s –1  for 0.8 s) to dark-adapted dry fronds and dim-light (∼10 μM m –2  s –1 ) exposed fronds. Preliminary measurements showed no difference between dark or dim-light adapted measurements. The difference between minimal fluorescence F 0  and maximal fluorescence F m  divided by F m , i.e., (F m -F 0 )/F m . We used this ratio to describe quantum yield (Q y ) of PS II system. Normal photosynthetic activity shows maximum Q y  of about 0.83 ( Maxwell and Johnson, 2000 ;  Murchie and Lawson, 2013 ). We considered reduced values indicative of stress. The F t  and Q y  data were collected from fresh, dried and 24 h heat treated fronds as well as after re-hydration for 1, 5, and 24 h at room temperature (25°C). Because obtaining reliable fluorescence measurements from curled (dried) fronds was difficult, the F t  and Q y  measurements were obtained from flattened fronds that were dried between paper towels and glass plates for 5 days at room temperature. Dried and submersed fronds were examined after temperature treatments. Fronds were rehydrated on water-saturated foam under dim light, and were measured after 1, 5, and 24 h. Q y  and F t  were identical in dark and dim-light-maintained fronds, we therefore report data of fronds measured under dim light (10 μM m –2  s –1 ). The F t  and Q y  measurements were obtained from the base, center, and the tip of each of six fronds and shown as average of these positions. Membrane Permeability Cell membrane permeability was deduced from the conductivity (μS cm –1 ) of the water in which the fronds were submersed. Conductivity was measured with a MW 301 EC meter (Milwaukee Instruments, Inc.) in 4 mL samples for partially and 20 mL samples in fully submersed fronds and reported as μS normalized to 10 mL. After heat treatments, fronds were kept at room temperature for an additional 24 h to assess re-uptake of ions. Elemental analysis was performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Optima 5300 DV) in 15% HNO 3 . Metabolic Activity In their natural environment, Pleopeltis fronds are exposed to sometimes extreme fluctuations of temperatures, humidity, and light intensities. Our intention is to understand how Pleopeltis responds to heat stress. Because measuring enzyme activities of dried fronds inevitably requires hydration, metabolic activities of dried fronds may not represent the actual activity in the dried state but indicate available metabolites and metabolic capacity at the endpoint of dehydration. Despite these limitations, the following tests were performed with dehydrated and hydrated fronds. Tissue Viability The reduction of resazurin as described in  John and Hasenstein (2017)  served as proxy for the assessment of vitality. Pinnae [100 mg dry weight equivalents, calculated as FW/(1-RWC) as documented in  John and Hasenstein (2018) ] were macerated in 2 mL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.2 mL of 4 mM resazurin (Sigma R7017), and incubated under continuous illumination (∼300 μM m –2  s –1 ) at 25°C for 3 h before the fluorescence of the supernatant was determined (Varian Cary, λex = 560 nm; λem = 590 nm). Hydroperoxide Determination Hydroperoxide (and other water-soluble peroxide) content was measured using the ferrous ammonium sulfate/xylenol orange, FOX I assay ( Wolff, 1994 ;  Cheeseman, 2006 ) at 560 nm ( John and Hasenstein, 2018 ). Hydroperoxide quantification in μM was based on a standard curve and calculated as (OD 560  – 0.004)/0.0763. Measurement of Lipid Peroxide The FOX II assay was used to quantify lipid peroxides, LOOHs ( Jiang et al., 1992 ;  Gay and Gebicki, 2003 ) according to  John and Hasenstein (2018)  such that (OD 560  − 0.1305)/0.0383, determines the BHT equivalent in nM. Catalase Activity Catalase activity was determined from the decrease of OD 240  of H 2 O 2  for 180 s ( John and Hasenstein, 2018 ). Based on 100 mg samples, enzyme activity was expressed as μM × min –1  × mg protein –1 . Consumption of Reduced Glutathione The consumption of GSH was measured as described earlier ( John and Hasenstein, 2018 ). The assay was modified after ( Starlin and Gopalakrishnan, 2013 ). Samples (100 mg DW equivalent) were extracted in chilled sodium phosphate buffer (40 mM, pH 7, 2 mL) and centrifuged (23,000  g , 12 min, 4°C). 500 μL supernatant was transferred into a fresh centrifuge tube, mixed with 400 μL 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 μL 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma, S-2002), 200 μL DI water, and vortexed. After adding 200 μL (4 mM) GSH (Cayman chemical company, 10007461) and 100 μL 2.5 mM H 2 O 2 , the solution was mixed and incubated for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (Aldrich Chemical Company, 76-03-9). The solution was incubated at RT for 30 min and centrifuged (23,000  g , 5 min, 4°C). The supernatant (500 μL) was mixed with 1.5 mL 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 1 mL 5, 5’-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Sigma, D8130). After inversion, OD 409 was determined. Enzyme activity is reported as μM GSH consumed min –1  × mg protein –1 . Protein Determination Protein content for the enzyme assays was determined according to  Bradford (1976)  using ovalbumin (Sigma, A-5378) as standard. Fatty Acid Analysis Fatty acids were extracted from tissue equivalent to 100 mg fresh weight, derivatized to their methyl esters, and quantified ( John and Hasenstein, 2018 ) using an Agilent (Wilmington, DE, United States) gas chromatograph (6890) with mass selective detector (5973). One μL samples were injected and separated on a Phenomenex Zebron ZB-5MS column with hydrogen as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min –1 . The temperature profile started at 100°C for 2 min, ramped (10°C × min –1 ) to 280°C and held for another 8 min. Identification of compounds was based on the National Institute of Science and Technology library 2008 in Chemstation software (E.02.02.1431). The quantity of individual fatty acids was determined based on retention time and slope of derivatized palmitic acid (Sigma, P-5917; Rt = 11.7 min; 3.98 × 106 TIC ng –1 ), linoleic acid (Sigma, L1376; Rt = 13.3 min, 3.53 × 106 TIC ng –1 ), linolenic acid (Cayman Chemical Company, 90210; Rt = 13.37 min; 2.51 × 106 TIC ng –1 ), oleic acid (Sigma, O1630; Rt = 13.4 min; 1.88 × 106 TIC ng –1 ), and stearic acid (Sigma, S-4751; Rt = 13.6 min; 3.05 × 106 TIC ng –1 ). Tissue samples were analyzed under identical conditions as standards. Statistical Analysis The data are reported as means of three to six biological replicates obtained from individual fronds. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer  post hoc  test was performed using Excel data analysis tool pack ( Microsoft Corporation, 2016 ). Results Morphological Response Pinnae of dried Pleopeltis fronds curled tighter with increasing temperature treatment ( Figures 2A–C ). Dried tissue showed no effects, but discolorations became visible after rehydration. Exposure to 55°C resulted in patchy browning along the mid-rib (rachis) of the frond ( Figure 2D ); after 60°C fronds were slightly ( Figure 2E ) and after 65°C completely discolored ( Figure 2F ). Submersed ( Figure 2G ) and partly submersed ( Figure 2J ) fronds showed no effects at 30°C but after exposure > 40°C submersed ( Figures 2H,I ) and partly submersed ( Figures 2K,L ) fronds showed browning. FIGURE 2 Response of dehydrated  (A,B,C) , submersed  (G,H,I) , and partly submersed  (J,K,L)  fronds to 24 h heating at 30, 40, and 50°C, and fronds re-hydrated after exposure to 55, 60, and 65°C  (D,E,F) . Exposure to ≥ 40°C resulted in tight curling of dehydrated fronds and browning of the hydrated fronds. Re-hydrated fronds show discoloration near the rachis between 55 and 60°C and complete discoloration of the frond after 65°C. Scale bar = 1 cm. Photosynthetic Performance Dried Frond Instantaneous fluorescence (F t ) of treated dried fronds measured lower than (control) dry fronds at 25°C ( Figure 3A ) while Q y  of fronds exposed to 30°C and higher was not detectable ( Figure 3B ). Interestingly, F t  of 65°C treated samples was higher than 60°C and not different from control ( Figure 3A ), whereas Q y  even after rehydration remained undetectable ( Figure 3B ). FIGURE 3 Chlorophyll fluorescence, F t \n (A,C,E)  and Q y \n (B,D,F)  data of dry, re-hydrated, partially, and fully submersed Pleopeltis fronds after 24 h exposure to different temperatures. Control values ± SE @ 25°C for F t  and Q y  of dry fronds are indicated by dashed lines  (A,B)  and for rehydrated fronds by dotted lines  (A–F) . The F t  and Q y  of heat-treated, dry samples are compared with 25°C dry samples  (A,B) ; dried fronds did not show measurable Q y  values regardless of temperature. Re-hydrated and hydrated samples are compared with 25°C fresh samples  (C–F) . Significant differences between controls and treatments are indicated by * ( P  ≤ 0.05) and ◆ ( P  ≤ 0.001); means ± SE,  n  = 6. Re-hydrated Fronds After rehydration, the chlorophyll fluorescence (F t ) increased over time and reached control levels within 5 h for temperatures up to 35°C ( Figure 3A ). However, exposure to higher temperatures (≤55°C) required a recovery period of 24 h. Despite the high F t  values, the Q y  decreased with higher temperatures ( Figure 3B ). F t  of 1-h re-hydrated fronds was low compared to (fresh) control but measurable at all temperature ranges, i.e., 30–65°C ( Figure 3A ). However, the Q y  value decreased from 30 to 50°C and was not detectable at > 50°C ( Figure 3B ). Similarly, F t  of fronds re-hydrated for 5 h after less than 40°C showed values similar to (fresh) controls ( Figure 3A ) but F t  was lower in rehydrated fronds exposed to ≥ 45° [ F (5,30) = 18,  P  < 0.0001]. The Q y  of 5 h re-hydrated fronds was lower than in controls [ F (8,45) = 37.5,  P  < 0.0001] but greater than after 1 h re-hydration [ F (1,94) = 55.8,  P  < 0.0001] ( Figure 3B ). Beyond 45°C, Q y  efficiency decreased steadily with increasing temperature ( Figure 3B ); there was no recovery after exposure to 65°C. Based on these data, Q y  is a better indicator of sensing heat than F t . Hydrated Fronds Despite some increase after 30 and 40°C treatments, F t  of partially submersed fronds decreased after exposure to temperatures higher than 40°C [ F (2,15) = 312,  P  < 0.0001] ( Figure 3C ); in contrast Q y  was already significantly reduced at 40°C [ F (1,10) = 217,  P  < 0.0001] ( Figure 3D ). After recovery (at room temperature for 24 h), F t  and Q y  of 30 and 35°C treated samples did not differ from controls ( Figures 3C,D ). However, in 40°C treated samples Q y  remained significantly lower than base-line values [ F (1,10) = 711.6,  P  < 0.0001], which suggests that hydration is beneficial for samples exposed to temperatures below 40°C. Unchanging but measurable F t  values in ≥ 45°C fronds and the lack of recovery of Q y  after 40°C indicates degradation of PS II. In fully submersed samples, chlorophyll fluorescence was higher but Q y  suppression was stronger than in partly submersed fronds ( Figure 3F ). All heat-stressed samples showed reduced F t  values after the recovery period, indicating that chlorophyll degradation continues during this time. The Q y  values of ≥ 40°C treated samples remained undetectable ( Figure 3F ). Overall, the samples exposed to ≥ 40°C showed a response similar to partially submersed fronds. The data clearly show that hydration renders the photosynthetic apparatus more sensitive to heat stress than dried fronds. Importantl",

The Q y  of 5 h re-hydrated fronds was lower than in controls [ F (8,45) = 37.5,  P  < 0.0001] but greater than after 1 h re-hydration [ F (1,94) = 55.8,  P  < 0.0001] ( Figure 3B ). Beyond 45°C, Q y  efficiency decreased steadily with increasing temperature ( Figure 3B ); there was no recovery after exposure to 65°C. Based on these data, Q y  is a better indicator of sensing heat than F t . Hydrated Fronds Despite some increase after 30 and 40°C treatments, F t  of partially submersed fronds decreased after exposure to temperatures higher than 40°C [ F (2,15) = 312,  P  < 0.0001] ( Figure 3C ); in contrast Q y  was already significantly reduced at 40°C [ F (1,10) = 217,  P  < 0.0001] ( Figure 3D ). After recovery (at room temperature for 24 h), F t  and Q y  of 30 and 35°C treated samples did not differ from controls ( Figures 3C,D ). However, in 40°C treated samples Q y  remained significantly lower than base-line values [ F (1,10) = 711.6,  P  < 0.0001], which sug",
  "discussion": "Discussion Our data describe diverse responses to separate desiccation and high temperature stresses. As stated under section “Materials and Methods,” it is important to reiterate the arbitrary nature of the study. The problematic aspects include the duration of the temperature treatment and the testing of various processes and enzymatic activities. It is unlikely that in nature temperatures greater than 40°C extend for more than 12 h. Nonetheless, heat tolerance was tested previously for an equally arbitrary time of 30 min, which resulted in tolerance of > 100°C ( Lange, 1955 ). While evaporative cooling likely provides some protection during short-term heat exposure, our heat treatments of 24 h exceeds naturally occurring conditions but provides enough time to assess metabolic responses. Similarly, submersion of fronds eliminates water stress but may cause different stress for the epiphytic Pleopletis as was shown by the lower reducing capacity ( Figure 6 ) and reduced Q y  ( Figure 3F ) of completely vs. partially submersed fronds ( Figure 3D ). This sensitivity may be the result of reduced gas exchange ( Voesenek et al., 2006 ), or the enhanced activity of symbiotic surface organisms ( Koch and Barthlott, 2009 ); both phenomena can lead to anoxia ( Blokhina et al., 2003 ;  Banti et al., 2010 ). Nonetheless, the differences between the submersion treatments illustrate the sensitivity of the fronds to different conditions and allow for nuanced evaluation of heat effects. Stress response includes changes in morphology, cellular functions, metabolism, and ultimately gene expression. Because of the reduced metabolism under dry conditions, it is likely that dry tissue shows reduced susceptibility to heat damage. The co-variance between desiccation and heat may induce changes in cell wall and thus frond shape ( Wu et al., 2018 ) a suitable indicator for heat stress of dry material ( Figure 2 ). However, fronds expanded even after exposure to 65°C; therefore, heat stress cannot be assessed solely through changes in shape or color. Changes in Frond Shape and Color In response to increasing temperature, dehydrated Pleopeltis fronds became thinner, pinnae curled tighter ( Figures 2B,C ), and after exposure to ≥ 45°C fronds became brittle. Such dramatic changes are likely a response to the combination of water loss and heat that reduces matrix hydration and therefore affects shape and elasticity of cell wall polymers ( Lima et al., 2013 ). These changes possibly indicate glass transition, which facilitates survival in ferns spores ( Ballesteros et al., 2017 ). Among the cell wall polymers, pectin affects the elasticity of the cell wall ( Willats et al., 2001 ) and heat sensitivity ( Lima et al., 2013 ). Loss of pectin functionality leads to increased cell wall porosity, brittleness, and conductive evaporation ( Willats et al., 2001 ;  Bethke et al., 2016 ). Pectin arrangements are likely modified in response to the combination of drying and elevated temp",
  "conclusion": "Conclusion The mechanism of Pleopeltis response to heat stress is complex. Our biochemical data indicate that > 40°C causes heat stress in Pleopeltis fronds. Despite obvious stress signals, dried fronds recovered after exposure up to 55°C while thermo-tolerance of hydrated fronds was limited to 40°C. The difference in heat tolerance between hydrated and dried fronds indicates that dehydration protects Pleopeltis from heat damage. Our data further illustrate the adaptability of this epiphytic fern to cope with environmental stress."
