  "abstract": "The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post-exposure stages.",

These unique hazards have been thought to induce adverse changes in the central nervous system (CNS), with a frequently reported impact on ocular function 1 – 4 . Resources aboard space assets that have a sustained human presence like the International Space Station (ISS) are limited and it is difficult to recreate spaceflight conditions on the ground for controlled experiments. Therefore, characterization of the type and magnitude of these changes is challenging. Despite these challenges, analogs can be used to inform the understanding of the spaceflight environment impacts on biology and support development of mitigation strategies to reduce spaceflight health risks. Ground-based analogs can also support the interrogation of biological effects from disparate stressors in isolation from one another that cannot be untangled in the spaceflight environment. Furthermore, advances in bioinformatics have expanded the potential scientific return of prior experiments provided data is accessible for re-evaluation. Fortunately, NASA’s GeneLab is an open-access omics database for space-relevant biological experiments that provides access to uniformly formatted data 5 . The current study leverages transcriptomic and methylation sequencing data acquired as part of a larger experiment to understand the longitudinal effects and underlying mechanisms of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) exposure and hindlimb unloading (HLU; an analog for microgravity) on neurovascular oxidative stress and brain function 6 . Global transcriptome profiling with RNA-seq quantifies gene expression at the time of sample acquisition while reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analyzes DNA methylation, which is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications involved in disease development 7 – 9 . Previous studies analyzed spaceflight-induced transcriptomic and epigenomic response in murine retina 10 , 11  or evaluated response to different ground-based hazard analogs in murine brain 6  and spleen 12 . The spaceflight studies reported expression and methylation changes in genes known to be involved in visual perception, phototransduction, and macular degeneration pathways in murine models. However, these studies were performed in space where effects of both space radiation and microgravity on the retina were intertwined. In addition, these studies were performed 35–37 days after a spaceflight and there was no analysis done on longitudinal changes in the retina due to radiation or microgravity. To our knowledge, the current analysis is the first multi-omics study of longitudinal changes in the murine retina due to microgravity, low-dose radiation, or combined exposure to both. We report differentially expressed genes (DEG), differentially methylated genes (DMG), and biological processes (BP) that are exclusive to, or shared across, multiple exposure conditions and post-exposure time points. We observed similar epigenetic and transcriptomic discordance in genes reported in the NASA Twins Study 13  and in the retina of mice flown to space 11 , with some changes persistent even 4 months after exposure. This study provides an insight into the retinal response to exposures that are frequently used as analogs for individual spaceflight hazard and their interplay at different post-exposure stages, and contributes towards identifying key pathways to interrogate that may provide translational relevance across exposure types. Results Differential gene expression Post-exposure timepoints had different global expression patterns that were visible in principal component analysis where samples clustered more closely based on time point/age of mice instead of the exposure condition (Supplementary Fig.  1 A). For both gene expression and methylation, each experimental group (Supplementary Table  S1 ) was compared to a control group (no radiation or HLU) with matched post-exposure duration, and significant differential expression was identified in eight out of the nine comparisons (Table  1 , Fig.  1 A,B). While the samples clustered by time point/age based on global gene expression, they could be separated by exposure condition within each time point when genes were selected based on differential expression (Supplementary Fig.  1 B, Fig.  1 B).

DEG counts are separated by down ( ↓ ) or up ( ↑ ) regulation; DML/DMR counts are separated by hypo ( ↓ ) or hyper ( ↑ ) methylation.

Figure 1 Differential gene expression in exposure groups. ( A ) Volcano plots showing DEG across each exposure condition (columns) at different time points (rows). Genes are colored by up-regulation (red) or down-regulation (blue) in exposed vs. control groups. Dashed green lines denote differential expression cutoffs of 0.05 and 0.263 for adjusted  p -value and magnitude of log 2 (fold-change), respectively. Counts for up- and down-regulated genes in each exposure group are listed above each plot.  (B)  Heatmaps corresponding to the hierarchical clustering analysis of DEG in each group. Relative variance stabilizing transformed (VST) gene counts across samples are displayed as colors ranging from blue (low) to red (high) as shown in the key.

The X-axis lists different intersection sets and is ordered by the number of intersecting groups in a given set. Dots are colored by exposure condition (magenta for IR, green for HLU, orange for combination).  DESeq2  was used for differential gene expression analysis and R packages  ggplot2 ,  pheatmap  and  ComplexUpset  were used for visualization.  DEG  differentially expressed genes,  HLU  hindlimb unloading,  IR  irradiation. The number of DEGs peaked at 7 days for groups exposed to only hindlimb unloading (HLU) or irradiation (IR) and showed a subsequent decline. The 275 DEG identified in 7-days IR were enriched in ocular disease terms (Supplementary Table  S2 ) whereas the 71 DEG identified in HLU alone had no significant enrichment of disease pathways. In the 1-month IR group, 7 out of the 31 DEG showed > twofold change (down-regulated:  Pon1, Sult1c1, Ermn, Stra6, Tmem72, Gm24514;  up-regulated:  Bc1 ).  Stra6  and  Pon1  are known to be involved in microphthalmia and diabetic retinopathy, respectively and  Bc1  affects vascular development 14  and structural plasticity 15 .  Prss56 , a gene implicated in human and murine refractive development and myopia 16 , was the only DEG at 4 months after exposure to IR alone. The highest number of DEG within HLU + IR (combination of hindlimb unloading and irradiation) was detected at 1 month post-exposure with no DEG at 7 days. The 64 DEG at 1 month included 20 genes with enrichment (adjusted  p -value 8.24e-08) in the  somatodendritic compartment  of the neuron where synaptic inputs are received and integrated, and 15 genes known to be targets of  mmu-miR-466 , a miRNA that regulates age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 17  (Supplementary Table  S3 ). Overlapping differentially expressed genes across exposure groups Nine DEG were common between the HLU-only and IR-only groups at 7 days (down-regulated:  Arl2bp, Chrna6, Egln1, Map2k1 , Stmn2 ; up-regulated:  Ccn2, Mbd6, Sox9, St6galnac2, Zfp36l1 ) (Fig.  1 C).  Bc1  and  Pgk1  were significantly up-regulated in all exposure groups at 1 month. Zinc finger protein  Zc3h11a  was significantly down-regulated in the HLU only group at 7 days but up-regulated at 1 month.  Zc3h11a  expression has been shown to be altered in the murine retina and sclera in an experimental myopia mouse model 18 . Only a single common DEG was observed between the HLU + IR and HLU groups at 4 months ( mt-Co2 ; up-regulated).  mt-Co2  is in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is an essential subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain 19 . An integrated analysis of mammalian spaceflight data has reported the kidney to show an induction of  mt-Co2 20 . Differential DNA methylation The 1-month HLU + IR group showed the highest total number (957) of differentially methylated loci (DML) and regions (DMR) in known genes (Table  1 , Fig.  2 A). In all exposure groups, hypermethylation was more frequent than hypomethylation. Among the hypermethylated loci, a higher proportion of methylation differences were associated with CpG shores than with islands except in all three exposures at 4 months (Fig.  2 A). Conversely, more hypomethylated loci overlapped with CpG islands than with shores in most of the groups except in all three groups at 7 days. The exposure groups at 4 months contained a higher proportion of total DML within CpG islands than shores compared to the other time points. Top 1% DML (roughly equivalent to methylation difference ≥ 20%; Supplementary Fig.  2 ) within CpG islands and exclusive to 4 months post-exposure were found in 17 genes across HLU (hypo:  Utp14a ; hyper:  Dlgap3 ), IR (hypo:  Gm7855, Rtn4rl2 ; hyper:  Maz, Shank3 ), and HLU + IR (hypo:  Bag3 ; hyper:  Aspdh, Map7d1 ,  Map7d2 , Morc4, Pcdh1, Pdzd11, Pik3ap1, Rtn4rl2, Suv39h1, Xk ). Figure 2 Differential methylation in exposure groups. ( A ) Total number of differentially methylated loci and regions within genes with hyper- or hypo-methylation in each exposure group categorized by whether they overlap with known CpG islands or shores.  (B)  Pairwise correlation plots for common differentially methylated sites. Differentially methylated loci (DML) with an adjusted  p -value ≤ 0.05 were selected from each of the nine groups and pairwise correlation for methylation difference was plotted for any given pair. The diagonal shows distribution of methylation difference (%) between exposure and matched control group. Pearson correlation value and significance are displayed on the right of the diagonal, and scatter plots with methylation differences for common DML from any two given groups are displayed on the left. Only significant correlations (> 3 shared DML and  p -value ≤ 0.05) are displayed.  (C)  Upset plot showing differentially methylated genes (DMG), defined as genes with their promoter or gene body containing a DML or DMR (adjusted  p -value ≤ 0.05, |methylation difference|≥ 10%), shared between at least two of the nine groups. The Y-axis represents the number of genes in a given intersection set. The X-axis lists different intersection sets and is ordered by the number of intersecting groups in a given set. Dots are colored by exposure condition (magenta for IR, green for HLU, orange for combination). R package  MethylKit  was used for differential methylation analysis,  genomation  and  GenomicRanges  were used for annotation of DML, and  ggplot2 ,  ggpairs  and  ComplexUpset  were used for visualization.  DML/R/G  differentially methylated loci/region/gene,  HLU  hindlimb unloading,  IR  irradiation. Correlation in methylation differences across exposure groups Pairwise analysis of all methylated loci in genes were compared across our 9 exposure groups (Fig.  2 B). The highest correlation in methylation difference across different exposures was observed at the same post-exposure time point. Hypermethylation of  Bclaf3  promoter was observed in four groups (~ 15% in 1m HLU, 4m IR and 4m HLU + IR, and 26% in 1m HLU + IR), and another CpG island in  Tmc8  promoter was common across all three exposure groups at 7 days (10% hypermethylation). The top DMLs shared across all three exposures were in  Cav2  at 7 days (30% hypermethylation),  Grip2  at 1 month (20% hypermethylation), and  Sorbs2  at 4 months (8% hypermethylation). Overlapping differentially methylated genes across exposure groups A number of genes containing DML or DMR were observed in multiple exposure groups and post-exposure time points (Fig.  2 C).  Bcl11b, Bclaf3, Gse1, Necab2, Plec  and  Tafa5  were each differentially methylated in five out of the nine groups. Six genes ( Adamts5, Gse1, Rbm15b, Fscn2, Satb1, Tenm3 ) were shared across different time points after radiation exposure, with  Adamts5  and  Fscn2  promoters being hypermethylated even after 4 months of exposure to radiation alone. The promoter region of  Pcdh19,  a protocadherin, was hypermethylated (> 20% methylation difference) at all three time points for HLU + IR and also in HLU alone at 7 days.  Bclaf3  was hypermethylated in five groups (HLU at 7 days and 1 month, HLU + IR at 1 month and 4 months, and IR and 4 months), and CpG islands in  Hmgb3  promoter were hypermethylated in HLU and HLU + IR at both, 7 days and 1 month. Biological processes affected by low-dose radiation and hindlimb unloading across multiple conditions and post-exposure time points Shared and exclusive biological processes across exposures and time points based on differential expression The top BP significantly enriched across all conditions 7 days after exposure included  morphogenesis of epithelium ,  ATP metabolism , and  nucleotide metabolism  (Fig.  3 A, Supplementary Table  S4 ). Processes related to  epithelial morphogenesis  were activated in the exposure groups, whereas all other processes were suppressed across the three conditions. All shared processes were activated in the 1-month groups, with the exception of  axon guidance  and  cell junction assembly , which were suppressed in the radiation only group. Common processes in the 1-month groups were related to  amine transport ,  regulation of membrane potential ,  synaptic vesicle exocytosis , and  neurotransmitter transport . At 4 months post-exposure, the top processes shared across the three exposure conditions were suppressed. These included  lens development in camera-type eye, wound healing, angiogenesis,  and  sulfur compound metabolic process . Figure 3 Common biological processes enriched in different exposure groups and at different time points.  (A)  Top 20 significantly enriched BP common across all exposure conditions for a given time point.  (B)  Significantly enriched BP common across all time points for a given exposure condition. Size of each point represents magnitude of normalized enrichment score (NES) while the color indicates activation (red) or suppression (blue) of the BP in the given exposure group compared to time point-matched controls. The Y-axis provides a description of common GO BP and the X-axis lists the ratio of genes that belong to a given gene set to the total number of genes in the gene set.  ClusterProfiler  was used for gene set enrichment analysis and the R package  ggplot2  was used for visualization.  BP  biological processes,  HLU  hindlimb unloading,  IR  irradiation,  NES  normalized enrichment score. Processes that were significantly enriched at all post-exposure time points for a given exposure condition were evaluated (Fig.  3 B, Supplementary Table  S4 ).  Nucleotide metabolism  was suppressed at 7 days and 4 months but activated at 1 month in mice subjected to microgravity alone, whereas  epithelial tube morphogenesis  and  lens development  were activated at 7 days but suppressed at all later time points, and  detection of light stimulus  was suppressed at 7 days and subsequently activated at 1 month and 4 months.  Retina homeostasis  was suppressed in the radiation only groups at 7 days and 1 month but activated at 4 months,  eye morphogenesis  was activated at 7 days and suppressed subsequently, and  synaptic vesicle endocytosis  was suppressed at 7 days but activated at all later time points. In the combination groups,  postsynapse assembly  was activated at all time points,  nucleotide metabolism  was activated only at 1 month, and  Rho signal transduction  was activated at 7 days and 1 month followed by suppression at 4 months.  Nucleotide metabolism  and related processes were significantly enriched in all nine groups with consistent activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months.  Pdk1  was within the gene set for  nucleotide metabolism  processes across all nine groups, and its expression was decreased at 7 days and 4 months but increased at 1 month in all exposure groups (Supplementary Fig.  3 ).  Pdk1  is a kinase known to play a key role in regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and is involved in cellular response to hypoxia 21 . As a complementary approach to examining shared processes, BP exclusive to each exposure condition (enriched in ≥ 2 post-exposure time points), or exclusive to each post-exposure time point were also examined (Table  2 , Supplementary Table  S5 ). Processes related to microtubule dynamics were enriched exclusively in HLU alone. IR-specific BP included  DNA conformation changes ,  Golgi organization ,  protein-DNA complex assembly , and  type I interferon response . The BP activated exclusively in IR but not enriched in HLU + IR at 7 days included  response to wounding, innate immune response, regulation of interleukin-6 production, heart morphogenesis, lipid metabolism,  and  epithelial cell proliferation . The processes suppressed exclusively in IR were related to  telomere organization, DNA repair, ncRNA metabolism, detection of light stimulus,  and  organelle localization by membrane tethering . Lastly, BP exclusive to HLU + IR were  postsynaptic density organization  and  regulation of AMPA receptors . Each post-exposure time point was associated with distinct BP enriched across multiple conditions only at the given time point. At 7 days, BP related to  proteasomal protein catabolism  were suppressed in all groups, and  mammary gland morphogenesis  was activated in IR and HLU + IR. Oncogenesis in the retina and breast have been linked by the regulation of cyclin D1 22 ; the gene encoding cyclin D1,  Ccnd1 , was significantly up-regulated 7 days after exposure to IR but was not differentially expressed at the later time points.  mRNA catabolic process  (suppressed) and  ion transmembrane transport  (activated) were among the BP exclusive to 1 month post-exposure. At 4 months,  glycerolipid metabolism ,  pigmentation , and  brown fat cell differentiation  were suppressed.

  "methods": "Methods Experimental conditions The original study was conducted at Loma Linda University following recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 50  and was approved on April 30, 2014, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028). A detailed description of the experimental setup has been published previously 51 . Briefly, a total of 59 six-month-old, female  C57BL/6 J  mice were housed in cages of same dimensions and subjected to one of four experimental conditions: sham control with no radiation or unloading (N = 15), hindlimb unloading (N = 14), low-dose irradiation (N = 15), and a combination of hindlimb unloading and low-dose irradiation (N = 15) for 21 days (Supplementary Table  1 ). Hindlimb suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Gamma radiation was delivered using  57 Co plates placed underneath the cages and a dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h was used to deliver a total dose of 0.04 Gy over a period of 21 days to simulate a space radiation environment. For the combination group, mice were exposed to unloading and simultaneously irradiated by  57 Co plate placed underneath the cages. Mice from each exposure condition were then allowed a post-exposure period of 7 days, 1 month, or 4 months, following which mice were euthanized and retinas were collected and frozen. RNA and DNA libraries were constructed and used for RNA-Seq and RRBS. The resulting data was deposited to GeneLab where RNA-seq output was processed per NASA GeneLab RNA-seq pipeline 52 , and RRBS results are available in the form of raw sequencing reads. Unnormalized RNA-seq counts and raw RRBS FastQ files were downloaded from GeneLab and used for the current analysis. Differential gene expression analysis Unnormalized RNA-seq counts were downloaded from GeneLab. Out of a total of 59 samples (Supplementary Table  S1 ), three were excluded from expression analysis due to low RNA integrity number values or high ribosomal RNA contamination. These counts were generated with GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline, which includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps. Full details of the pipeline including the parameters used for each individual tool have been previously published 52 . RNA-seq counts were subsequently analyzed with  DESeq2  (v1.30.1) 53  where counts were first normalized using the median-of-ratios method followed by differential gene expression analysis comparing each experimental group to the corresponding post-exposure time point-matched control group. Differentially expressed genes were determined using cutoffs of 0.263 and 0.05 for log 2 (fold-change) and Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted  p -value, respectively, to be consistent with analyses of brain and spleen tissues from the same set of mice 6 , 12 .

For both gene expression and methylation, each experimental group (Supplementary Table  S1 ) was compared to a control group (no radiation or HLU) with matched post-exposure duration, and significant differential expression was identified in eight out of the nine comparisons (Table  1 , Fig.  1 A,B).

  "discussion": "Discussion Spaceflight is an environment to which Earth-based biological systems have not yet adapted. Changes in gravity as well as radiation exposure that differs from terrestrial radiation both in terms of intensity and type, are the two primary naturally occurring hazards the human body contends with during space travel. It is crucial to characterize the impacts of these hazards to ensure the crew and NASA as an agency are appropriately informed. While hazards will be experienced concurrently in spaceflight, important information about the potential interactions between hazards can reveal how impacts can be appropriately mitigated. Different countermeasure strategies will need to be employed if hazards modulate similar or divergent processes. It is important to note the current study leverages data from a previously performed animal study where mice were exposed to gamma-rays and microgravity as analogs of space radiation and microgravity respectively. However, even with the inherent limitations of using analogs, the observed results still provide insights on processes related to retinal dysfunction due to individual and combined exposures, at different time points, allowing us to gain a preliminary understanding of longitudinal changes. Compared to expression results from other tissue types collected in accompanying studies, spleen data from 7 days post-exposure showed highest number of DEG in HLU alone 12 , brain data from 4 months had most DEGs in HLU + IR 6 , whereas the retina results presented here showed DEGs peaked in IR alone at 7 days, and HLU + IR at 1 month. Combined stressors can induce complex responses further regulated by factors such as radiation type, post-exposure duration, and tissue type. Given the conflicting results from various studies addressing synergies between microgravity and radiation and their impact on DNA damage repair and cellular repair 27 , further work is needed to understand their interplay. Biological processes shared across, or exclusive to, exposure conditions and post-exposure stages were identified (Fig.  1 , Table  2 , Supplementary Table  S5 ), and  nucleotide metabolism  was enriched in all the groups with activation at 1 month, suppression at 7 days and even lower at 4 months for all exposures. The suppression of nucleotide metabolism has been shown to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of the stable growth arrest of oncogene-induced senescence 28 . Further work is required to understand the mechanism behind the activation at 1 month with a return to being suppressed at 4 months, and the specific role of  Pdk1  in process modulation. Several genes known to be implicated in ocular diseases were found to be impacted at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. A subset of the 7-days radiation only DEG ( Cryaa, Cryba1, Cryba2, Cryba4, Crybb1, Crybb2, Crybb3, Crygs, Bsfp1 ) were enriched in  nuclear and congenital cataracts , however, these genes were not dysregulated at 1 month or 4 mo",
