  "abstract": "A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in  Drosophila  is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant  dappled  have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The  dappled  gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of  dappled  cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the  dappled  melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall,  dappled  provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms.",

  "full_text": "Introduction \n Drosophila  is well studied as a model of innate immunity in humans and has been instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that involve both immune induction and hematopoiesis (Lemaitre and Hoffmann  2007 ). The  Drosophila  Toll pathway mediates the response to microbial infections, and humans were subsequently found to have a family of Toll receptors that also respond to infections. Other shared immune signaling pathways are the Imd (immune deficiency)/TNF1 (tumor necrosis factor 1), JNK (Jun kinase), and JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-STAT transcription factor) pathways. Activation of NFkB transcription factors, which regulate target genes such as cytokines and antimicrobial proteins, is a key shared feature (Wang and Ligoxygakis  2006 ). Like the signaling pathways, the cell and tissue components of the  Drosophila  and human immune systems are analogous (Kimbrell and Beutler  2001 ). In  Drosophila , the hemocytes and the fat body mediate, respectively, the major cellular and humoral arms of the response. Hemocytes participate in immune signaling to the fat body, phagocytosis, damaged tissue surveillance, encapsulation of foreign intruders, and remodeling of cells during development and also respond to aberrant self-cells to form melanotic tumors/pseudotumors (Babcock et al.  2008 ; Brennan et al.  2007 ; Gateff  1994 ; Rizki and Rizki  1983 ; Tepass et al.  1994 ; Vass and Nappi  2000 ). The fat body, like the mammalian liver, produces abundant humoral response molecules, including antimicrobial peptides released into the hemolymph (Aggrawal and Silverman  2007 ). \n Drosophila  produces three types of hemocytes: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells (Crozatier and Meister  2007 ). Plasmatocytes account for ~95% of total blood cells and most functions. In particular, plasmatocytes are responsible for the phagocytosis of microorganisms during an infection and apoptotic cells during development. Lamellocytes are produced only in response to parasites or by mutations that produce melanotic tumors. Crystal cells constitute ~5% of total blood cells and are involved in melanization. As in vertebrates,  Drosophila  blood cells also have two developmental origins: one early in the embryonic head mesoderm and another during larval development in the lymph gland (Evans et al.  2003 ). Molecular cascades and factors regulating hematopoiesis are also shared with humans and involve many pathways, for example, Toll, JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, Notch, GATA, and Runx (Evans and Banerjee  2003 ; Mandal et al.  2007 ). A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in  Drosophila  is that of melanotic tumors or nodules. Melanotic nodules may be in the hemocoel or associated with the lymph glands and consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells that are covered by lamellocytes and melanized, similar to the immune response to a parasitic wasp egg (Luo et al.  1995 ; Meister and Lagueux  2003 ; Minakhina and Steward  2006b ; Stofanko et al.  2008 ). Mutations in a variety of genes and genetic pathways have been found to produce this phenotype, such as JAK–STAT, which is also associated with blood cell overproliferation in humans, the Toll pathway, and Ras/MAPK (Asha et al.  2003 ; Li  2008 ; Minakhina and Steward  2006a ; Zettervall et al.  2004 ). Some other genes with this mutant phenotype are  air \n 8 , encoding ribosomal protein s6 (Watson et al.  1992 );  black pearl , encoding a DnaJ homolog (Becker et al.  2001 );  l(3)malignant blood  neoplasm, encoding a protein with human cytokeratin homology (Gateff  1994 );  yantar , encoding a conserved arginine-rich protein (Sinenko et al.  2004 ); and the Polycomb group gene  multi sex combs  (Remillieux-Leschelle et al.  2002 ). The melanotic tumor genes are an important category to identify and define in order to understand blood cell function and regulation. In a P-element enhancer detector screen concentrating on immune-related tissues and phenotypes, we identified the melanotic tumor gene  dappled  ( dpld ) (Rodriguez et al.  1996 ). Enhancer detector expression of  dappled  was high in the fat body, oenocytes, ring gland, and gut. Lethal and viable mutations of  dappled  produced melanotic tumors, and lethal mutation was also associated with aberrant tissue morphology, for example, of the fat body and gut (Rodriguez et al.  1996 ). A distinguishing feature of  dappled  mutants is consistent melanotic tumor formation, in contrast to other melanotic tumor mutants, which typically have low and variable rates. We now report identification of  dappled  as a member of the cytochrome b5 family. Cytochrome b5 is a conserved, ubiquitous, small hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways, such as fatty acid desaturation, cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions, sterol metabolism, and conversion of methemoglobin (Schenkman and Jansson  2003 ). Cytochrome b5 is thus involved in processes such as metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, maintenance of oxygen levels, and production of steroid hormones (Locuson et al.  2007 ; Miller  2005 ; Yamazaki and Shimada  2006 ). Cytochrome b5 genetics in higher organisms has not been very amenable to study, and  dappled  provides a new avenue of approach for study of cytochrome b5 functions. In this report, we characterize the  dappled  mutant hemocyte phenotype and present the potential to study cytochrome b5 function by screening for compounds that affect the  dappled  hemocyte phenotype. Materials and Methods Drosophila  Stocks and Rearing Oregon R flies were used as the standard wild-type strain. The  dappled  mutants are the  dpld \n MLB  (97/16) and  dpld \n EJL  (142/2) strains of Rodriguez et al. ( 1996 ). Experiments were performed using  dpld \n MLB / dpld \n EJL  transheterozygotes or  dpld  mutants hemizygous with  Df(2R)ST1  (Bloomington Stock Center). The  hemese - Gal4  strain is that of Zettervall et al. ( 2004 ). The  UAS - dappled  transgenic strain was made using the cDNA clone RE66521 from the Bloomington Drosophila Genome Project, which matched our splice product for  dappled  mRNA (see below). The insert of plasmid RE66521 was isolated using the  Eco RI and  Bam HI restriction enzyme sites, ligated into the  Eco RI and  Xba I sites of the pUAST vector using  Bam HI/ Xba I linkers, and transgenic strains made by Genetic Services, Inc. Insertion strains of  UAS - dappled  into chromosomes X, 2, and 3 were recovered. All stocks were raised on the Bloomington Stock Center food recipe in a 25°C incubator. For the curcumin-raised flies, the food, before cooling, was supplemented with 20 mg/ml curcumin (Sigma), and parents were placed onto the food for mating and egg laying. Compare with Gupta et al. ( 2009 ), in which doses for mice were 5, 30, and 60 mg/kg orally, daily for 19 days, and note that at 100 mg/ml, flies had high lethality in addition to developmental delay. Molecular Genetic Analysis Genomic DNA fragments flanking the  dappled  97/16 (k09716) and 142/2 (k14202) P-element insertion sites were recovered by the plasmid rescue technique (Wilson et al.  1989 ), sequenced (Davis Sequencing), and aligned to the genome (Blast). The PCR primers used to compare the 88/15 (k08815) strain P-element insertion sequences  AQ034113  and  AQ025871  (Tweedie et al.  2009 ) to wild-type sequences were TATCGTCGCTGTGCTTACAGAT (60, forward) and CTAAACCTCCAATTCGGCTATG (61, reverse) at the  AQ034113  end and CTCCACGCGTAATATACCCATT (58, forward) and AGTCATGGATGCGTAGTCACAC (59, reverse) at the  AQ025871  end. In order to confirm the 88/15 insertion site, PCR fragments that resulted from the P-element end primer  Rsy II (Tweedie et al.  2009 ) in combination with primers 59 and 60 were sequenced. The PCR primers used to test for possible alternative splicing of CG2140/ dappled  were sequences 55, 56, and 57 (Fig.  1 ). The sequence of the single transcript detected was translated to an amino acid sequence and placed into the cytochrome b5 family by Blast comparison. Clustal W was used to align the  dappled  cytochrome b5 sequence to selected other cytochrome b5 proteins. Fig. 1 The  dappled  locus.  a  Four P-element insertions in  dappled /CG2140 produce mutations with a melanotic tumor phenotype (k09716, k00107, k14202, and 01857). These four  dappled  insertions and the 03427 and 05643 insertions are included within the k08815 deletion. Insertions 03610 and 08492 are outside the  dappled  and k08815 regions. One  dappled  mRNA transcript has been detected, and it has one intron spanning from +120 to +1712 ( dotted line ). The numbers 55, 56, and 57 indicate the positions of PCR primers used to test for alternative mRNA splicing products; only the 55–57 pair produced a PCR product.  Black bars  indicate the  dappled  protein coding region.  b  Sequence of the  dappled /CG2140 gene. The sequence of the PCR fragment obtained from primers 55 and 57 to total adult RNA was combined with the sequence data for CG2140 at Flybase (Tweedie et al.  2009 ). Transcribed sequence with 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR is shown in  capital letters . The protein encoding sequence is  underlined , with the ATG start site  shaded gray , and the translated amino acid sequence is below the  underline .  Bold  and  italicized  sequences indicate the primers 55, 56, and 57 \n Northern Blot Analysis Total RNA was isolated using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion), and poly-A RNA was isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA Purification kit (Qiagen). The RNA was run on formaldehyde gels and transferred overnight using Ambion Northern Max reagents. The  dappled  probe was 642 bp defined by the primers 55 and 57 (Fig.  1 ). This 642 bp PCR fragment was subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. After blue/white screening to select the colony, PCR and sequencing were used to confirm the insert and determine orientation. Transcription used T7 polymerase and  32 P-labeled UTP and the Ambion Strip EZ kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. The rp49 probe was made using the primers TCCTTCCAGCTTCAAGATGACC (forward) and AGAAGTTCCTGGTGCACAACGT (reverse). Hybridization was overnight, and a Fuji phosphoimager and ImageJ were used to analyze the hybridization signal. Blood Cell Counts Third-instar larvae were developmentally staged as early versus late wandering phase based on retention in the gut of food dye (Zettervall et al.  2004 ). The Bright-Line Counting Chamber (Fisher) hemocytometer was used to count blood cells stained with monochlorobimane dye (Tirouvanziam et al.  2004 ) or GFP-expressing blood cells as in Zettervall et al. ( 2004 ), except that instead of red food color we used blue (Deep Blue Shade, Esco Foods, Inc.). Siblings that were heterozygous for  dappled  were distinguished based on either a CyO balancer with the marker y+ (i.e.,  y ; +/ dpld  vs.  y ; +/ CyO, y +) or B-galactosidase staining to indicate presence or absence of a  dpld  enhancer trap (Rodriguez et al.  1996 ). Separate counts of blood cells in  y  versus  y + larvae established that  y  did not affect the blood cell counts. Determination of sex was by the size of the gonads or by marking the sexes with  y  versus  y +. Hemocyte counts from different samples were compared using the  t  test, and  P  values were calculated using VassarStats ( http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html ). Results Cytochrome b5, the Encoded Product of  dappled The original  dappled  alleles,  dpld \n EJL  and  dpld \n MLB , result from the P-element insertions (P-lacW) in strains 142/2 (k14202) and 97/16 (k09716), respectively (Rodriguez et al.  1996 ). The  dpld \n EJL  allele is homozygous and hemizygous lethal, and  dpld \n MLB  is homozygous and hemizygous viable. Heteroallelic  dpld \n EJL \n /dpld \n MLB  is also viable and, like  dpld \n EJL \n and dpld \n MLB  homozygotes and hemizygotes, has melanotic tumors (Rodriguez et al.  1996 ). In order to identify the gene associated with the melanotic tumor phenotype, we molecularly cloned and sequenced the  dappled  gene. We used the technique of plasmid rescue to isolate the genomic DNA flanking the k14202 and k09716 insertions. Sequencing of the flanking DNA and alignment to the genome placed both insertions into the 5′ UTR of CG2140 (Tweedie et al.  2009 ), with k09716 46 bp farther upstream than k14202 (Fig.  1 ). In contrast to our results, genome annotation assigned  dappled  as CG1624 based on the position of the lethal P-element insertion 88/15 (k08815), which did not complement the 142/2 insertion (Spradling et al.  1999 ). We therefore investigated this discrepancy in the identification of  dappled.  The 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences for the k08815 insertion are 3′- AQ034113  and 5′- AQ025871 . Alignment of these flanking sequences on the latest  Drosophila  genome sequence, however, places them 176,059 bp apart. There are several potential causes for this gap in the sequence: multiple insertions, an error in data reporting, or a large deletion. To test for the accuracy of the k08815 flanking sequence, primers were designed to (1) flank the 3′ and 5′ insertion sites of the k08815 transposon and (2) extend from a P-element end primer (p Rsy II) into a flanking sequence. The resultant PCR fragments supported the published flanking sequences, as wild-type products were not observed in the mutant strain and both insertion sites were verified with the P-element end primer (Fig.  1 ). Finally, these PCR products were sequenced to provide confirmation of the flanking sequences. These results indicate that k08815 is not a simple insertion but is associated with additional disruption at its genomic position. We set out to differentiate between either multiple insertions or a large deletion by performing complementation tests with other lethal insertion strains in the region. Complementation tests confirmed that a large deletion accompanies the k08815 insertion (Fig.  1 ). Complementation and mapping also placed two more insertions, k00107 and 01857, into the 5′ UTR and intron of CG2140/ dappled , respectively (Fig.  1 ). We tested these various  dappled  mutants for alterations in transcription, further confirming that the  dappled  phenotype results from an effect on CG2140, by performing Northern blot analysis using RNA from  dappled  mutants. This analysis showed a decrease in CG2140 transcript levels in the  dappled  mutants compared with the Oregon R controls (Fig.  2 ). The  dappled  strains are hypomorphic, with the lethal alleles stronger. The lethal allele  dpld \n EJL  expresses approximately 10% of wild-type embryonic RNA levels, whereas the viable allele  dpld \n MLB  has ~80% of wild-type adult RNA levels. Analysis of the transcripts by RT-PCR and sequencing showed one splice variant, with a single intron (Fig.  1 ). Fig. 2 The  dappled  transcript levels are reduced in  dappled  mutants. Northern blot analysis of  dappled  transcripts shows reduced levels in mutants compared with wild type.  Upper panels : Northern blots after probing with labeled  dappled .  Lower panels : control for loading of RNA in each lane by reprobing the blots with labeled  rp49 .  a  Adult total RNA from Oregon R ( lane 1 ),  dpld \n MLB / dpld \n EJL  transheterozygotes ( lane 2 ), and  dpld \n MLB  homozygotes ( lane 3 ).  b  Embryonic total RNA from Oregon R ( lane 1 ) and  dpld \n 01857  homozygotes ( lane 2 ); embryonic poly-A RNA from Oregon R ( lane 4 ), and  dpld \n EJL  homozygotes ( lane 5 ).  Lane 3  contains no RNA. Embryos from the homozygous lethal strains  dpld \n EJL  and  dpld \n 01857  were sorted via a Balancer chromosome expressing GFP ( CyO, Kr - GFP ), in order to select for the homozygous mutant embryos. Quantitation after correcting for loading using  rp49  shows reduced levels of  dappled  RNA in all mutants. Compared with wild type, approximate levels are ( a ) 65% in  lane 2  and 80% in  lane 3 ; ( b ) 40% in  lane 2  and 10% in  lane 5 \n \n Based on sequence homology from our alignments and the Flybase Genome Annotation,  Drosophila  gene CG2140/ dappled  encodes a microsomal cytochrome b5 (Fig.  1 ;  http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033189.html ). Genome annotation has identified CG2140 as the only cytochrome b5 in  Drosophila . One related  Drosophila  sequence has been identified, cytochrome b5-related (Cyt-b5-r;  http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000406.html ). Cyt-b5-r has 436 residues (there are only 134 for Dappled and 135 for human cytochrome b5), and only 30 of the Cyt-b5-r residues are identical to the Dappled sequence. In a comparison of the  dappled  encoded amino acid sequence with a selection of other cytochrome b5 proteins from mammals and insects, Dappled has 45% identity with human cytochrome b5 and 76% identity with housefly cytochrome b5 (Fig.  3 ). Overall, the selected mammals and insects have 32% identity. Cytochrome b5 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous family of small hemoproteins that participate in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions. These reactions are involved in many biological processes, such as conversion of methemoglobin, sterol metabolism, fatty acid desaturation, and cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions (Schenkman and Jansson  2003 ). Fig. 3 Cytochrome b5 sequences. The sequences of Dappled and selected other cytochrome b5 proteins from insects and mammals are compared using Clustal W for alignment and consensus generation (Prim. Cons.). See Wang et al. ( 2007 ) for an X-ray crystal structure comparison of the heme binding domain, residues 6–95. Note the high sequence identity within this region, which is 82% for residues 40–73. Sequence accession numbers are  Rattus norvegicus  GenBank  AAB67610.1 ;  Mus musculus  Swiss-Prot  P56395.2 ;  Sus scrofa  Swiss-Prot  P00172.3 ,  Homo sapiens  GenBank  AAA35729.1 ;  Drosophila  dappled GenBank  HQ864711 ;  Musca domestica  GenBank  AAA56985.1 ;  Anopheles gambiae  GenBank  AAO24766.1 \n Hemocyte Misregulation and Melanotic Nodule Formation in  dappled  Mutants The  dpld \n MLB  insertion has made analysis possible, as in addition to producing consistent melanotic tumor formation, it is the only viable allele. Maintenance of  dpld \n MLB  homozygotes as a stock, however, was not feasible because of effects on fertility. Homozygous  dpld \n MLB  or transheterozygous  dpld \n MLB / dpld \n EJL  females and males produced few progeny, even when mated with wild-type flies (<5 progeny/ dappled  parent), and mutant females laid few eggs (~50/female). It is unlikely that this fertility problem is due simply to physical obstruction in the abdomen, because flies with less obtrusive tumors (i.e., small tumors near the thorax) also show low fertility. To avoid the effects of accumulation of second site mutations by maintaining the  dpld \n MLB  chromosome over a balancer, all experiments were done on progeny from crosses that produced transheterozygotes or hemizygotes. The development of the Gal4–UAS system (Brand and Perrimon  1993 ) to include drivers for the hematopoietic system makes it more feasible to be able to investigate the blood cell phenotypes of mutant genes, for example, Kimbrell et al. ( 2002 ) and Zettervall et al. ( 2004 ). The  hemese - Gal4  construct drives expression in blood cells of the plasmatocyte and lamellocyte classes (Zettervall et al.  2004 ). Strains with  hemese - Gal4 UAS - GFP  thus have the blood cells marked with GFP, enabling hemocyte counting and phenotype analysis in various genetic strains (Zettervall et al.  2004 ). We used  hemese - Gal4 \n UAS - GFP  to investigate the blood cells of  dappled  melanotic tumor mutants. In melanotic tumors of  dpld \n EJL \n /dpld \n MLB ;  hemese - Gal4 UAS - GFP  larvae, all of the cells in the masses were found to fluoresce strongly for GFP (Fig.  4 ). Cell counts of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes showed large numbers of circulating lamellocytes (Fig.  4 ). Lamellocyt",

There are several potential causes for this gap in the sequence: multiple insertions, an error in data reporting, or a large deletion. To test for the accuracy of the k08815 flanking sequence, primers were designed to (1) flank the 3′ and 5′ insertion sites of the k08815 transposon and (2) extend from a P-element end primer (p Rsy II) into a flanking sequence. The resultant PCR fragments supported the published flanking sequences, as wild-type products were not observed in the mutant strain and both insertion sites were verified with the P-element end primer (Fig.  1 ). Finally, these PCR products were sequenced to provide confirmation of the flanking sequences. These results indicate that k08815 is not a simple insertion but is associated with additional disruption at its genomic position. We set out to differentiate between either multiple insertions or a large deletion by performing complementation tests with other lethal insertion strains in the region. Complementation tests confirmed that a large deletion accompanies the k08815 insertion (Fig.  1 ). Complementation and mapping also placed two more insertions, k00107 and 01857, into the 5′ UTR and intron of CG2140/ dappled , respectively (Fig.  1 ). We tested these various  dappled  mutants for alterations in transcription, further confirming that the  dappled  phenotype results from an effect on CG2140, by performing Northern blot analysis using RNA from  dappled  mutants. This analysis showed a decrease in CG2140 transcript levels in the  dappled  mutants compared with the Oregon R controls (Fig.  2 ). The  dappled  strains are hypomorphic, with the lethal alleles stronger. The lethal allele  dpld \n EJL  expresses approximately 10% of wild-type embryonic RNA levels, whereas the viable allele  dpld \n MLB  has ~80% of wild-type adult RNA levels. Analysis of the transcripts by RT-PCR and sequencing showed one splice variant, with a single intron (Fig.  1 ). Fig. 2 The  dappled  transcript levels are reduced in  dappled  mutants.

  "discussion": "Discussion We have identified  dappled  as a member of the conserved, ubiquitous cytochrome b5 family. The complexities of cytochrome b5 function, through its participation in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions, are reflected in the difficulties and limited study of its genetics in higher organisms. Characterizations in humans have shown that cytochrome b5 mutation causes methemoglobinemia, which interferes with the balance between hemoglobin and methemoglobin, thus affecting oxygenation and inflammation (Hegesh et al.  1986 ; Umbreit  2007 ). Mutation of cytochrome b5 reductase also causes methemoglobinemia and is more common (Davis et al.  2004 ). In addition, one case of cytochrome b5 methemoglobinemia may also have been associated with hormonal defects (Giordano et al.  1994 ). With the exception of a porcine mutation associated with an altered androstenone level (Lin et al.  2005 ), cytochrome b5 mutations in other organisms have not been identified. In mice, cytochrome b5 deletion is also lethal, but experiments with a tissue-specific knockout have allowed liver function to be addressed (Finn et al.  2008 ). With our studies of  dappled ,  Drosophila  now provides a tractable genetic model for the study of cytochrome b5 in blood cells and other tissues. Hemocytes are particularly sensitive to mutation of  dappled  and show that cytochrome b5 functions to produce normal differentiation and numbers of hemocytes. Mutation of one copy of  dappled  results in a significant increase in the number of circulating hemocytes, and mutation of both copies results in the formation of melanotic nodules. The formation of  dappled  melanotic nodules is a Class 2 reaction in the classification of Watson et al. ( 1991 ), in which Class 2 represents alteration of immune cells and Class 1 represents normal immune cells responding to other cell types that are aberrant. The dominant effect on blood cell number emphasizes that wild-type levels of cytochrome b5 are needed for full normal functions. In humans, levels of cytochrome b5 have been implicated as important with respect to xenobiotic metabolism and health. Kurian et al. ( 2007 ) hypothesized that functionally significant genetic variability in cytochrome b5 occurs in individuals without clinical symptoms. They investigated processing of hydroxylamines, which are oxidative products of arylamine drugs and environmental carcinogens, by the mutant cytochrome b5 of one heterozygous individual and found, in vitro, altered affinity for hydroxylamine substrates and dramatically reduced cytochrome b5 expression (Kurian et al.  2007 ). Expression of wild-type  dappled  in hemocytes rescued both the increase in blood cell number and the formation of melanotic nodules. The driver used was  hemese - Gal4 , which is active in circulating plasmatocytes and sessile hemocytes, but not the lymph glands (Markus et al.  2009 ; Zettervall et al.  2004 ). Interestingly, the sessile hemocytes are a newly discov",
