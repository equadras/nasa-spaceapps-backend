  "full_text": "Introduction In terrestrial vascular plants, monolignol coupling affords the lignans ( 1 ), as well as the polymeric structural lignins ( 2 ), with the latter being the most abundant plant biopolymers next to cellulose. The former are, however, a very diverse class of vascular plant natural products, typically dimers and/or higher oligomers, whose physiological roles  in planta  are considered mainly involved in plant defense, particularly in leaf, (heart)wood, knot, and seed coat tissues. Many lignans are optically active and can have diverse coupling modes, although the 8–8′ interunit (dimer) linkage is perhaps the most commonly encountered ( 1 ). Some are also medicinally important, such as podophyllotoxin, or its semi-synthetic derivatives, etoposide, teniposide, and Etopophos® widely used in cancer therapies ( 1 ). The entry point into presumed phenoxy radical-radical coupling to the 8–8′ lignan class involves one electron oxidation of the monolignol,  e.g.  coniferyl alcohol ( Fig. 1 A ,  1 ), which in the presence of a specific type of dirigent protein (DP; from the Latin  dirigere , to guide or to align) 2  ( 3 ), can undergo distinct forms of stereoselective coupling to afford either the (+)- or the (−)-antipode of pinoresinol ( Fig. 1 A ,  2a  or  2b ) ( 1 ,  3 – 6 ). Mechanistically, one electron oxidation ( e.g.  catalyzed by laccases, peroxidases) is envisaged to generate the corresponding coniferyl alcohol ( 1 )-derived free radical intermediate (CA • ), which then binds to the DPs. Bound substrate orientation subsequently occurs in such a way as to enable 8–8′ coupling at the  si-si  face with concomitant intramolecular cyclization to afford (+)-pinoresinol ( Fig. 1 A ,  2a ), such as in  Forsythia intermedia  ( 3 ),  Thuja plicata  ( 4 ),  Schizandra chinensis  ( 5 ), or pea ( Pisum sativum ) ( 7 ), or alternatively  re-re  coupling to give the (−)-antipode ( Fig. 1 A ,  2b ) as in  Arabidopsis  ( 1 ,  5 ,  6 ) and flax ( Linum usitatissimum ). 3  Of these, the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP in pea is annotated as PsDRR206 ( 9 ), and the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP in  Arabidopsis thaliana  is named AtDIR6 ( 5 ).

In this investigation, determination of the x-ray crystal structure of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP PsDRR206 is reported. These results are discussed with regard to previously proposed mechanisms for DP-mediated CA •  coupling ( 10 ) and a published homology model of AtDIR6 ( 11 ), as well as existing x-ray structures of allene oxide cyclase (AOC) ( 12 ,  13 ). AOC is a plant enzyme that forms 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, an intermediate in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, from a reactive allene oxide precursor, 12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate ( 14 ). AOC shares distant sequence similarity to DPs. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression, and Purification of PsDRR206 The PsDRR206 gene (GenBank TM  accession number  U11716 ) was isolated from pea ( P. sativum  cv. Alcan) genomic DNA using PCR amplification with gene specific primers (DRR206 forward, ATGGGTTCCAAACTTCTAGTACTA, and DRR206 reverse, TTACCAACACTCAAAGAACTTGAT). Vector construction and transformation were carried out using biolistic bombardment technology as described by Seneviratne  et al.  ( 7 ), as was expression and purification of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming PsDRR206 recombinant DP in tomato cell culture. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection Initial crystallization conditions for the PsDRR206 protein were obtained using the microbatch under oil method employing 1536-well microassay plate high throughput screening ( 15 ) at the Hauptman Woodward Institute (Buffalo, NY). Four conditions from preliminary screening produced microcrystals: condition 265, 0.1  m  (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.1  m  CAPS pH 10, PEG8000 20% (v/v); condition 1006, 0.1  m  NH 4 Br, 0.1  m  Tris, pH 8, PEG 400 40% (v/v); condition 1077, 5% 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (w/v), 0.09  m  Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.8, and 27% PEG 3350; and condition 1474, 0.1  m  NaCl, 0.1  m  NaOAc, pH 5.0, PEG 400 80% (w/v). Initial “hits” were scaled up in-house as hanging drop vapor diffusion methods on VDX 24-well plates (Hampton Research, CA) incubated at 22 °C with a drop size of 3 μl consisting of equal volumes of protein at a concentration of 4–5 mg/ml in 40 m m  MES, pH 5, 20 m m  Na 2 SO 4 , 20% glycerol, and reservoir solution. Each drop was equilibrated against a 500-μl reservoir and monitored periodically. Crystallization conditions were further optimized using grid screening. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained from the final optimized crystallization condition 1077, comprising 4% 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (w/v), 0.1  m  Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.8, and 35% PEG 3350. Crystals appeared within 5–10 days and grew to the size of 170 × 170 × 150 μm within 10 weeks. The PsDRR206 crystals were subsequently flash cooled in a cryoprotectant crystallization buffer, stored in cryovials, and shipped to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource for data collection. Native PsDRR206 crystals, diffracting to ∼1.95 Å resolution, belong to the rhombohedral space group H32 (see  Table 1 ). A complete data set comprising 600 images with a rotation angle of 0.2° was collected from a single PsDRR206 crystal on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource Beamline BL12-2 using x-rays at 12,658 eV (0.98093 Å) and a PILATUS 6  m  PAD detector running in the shutterless mode. The data were processed with XDS ( 16 ) and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 suite of programs ( 17 ). The Matthews coefficient ( 18 ) assuming two molecules in the asymmetric unit was 2.0 Å 3 /Da (39% solvent content). The final data collection statistics are given in  Table 1  ( 19 ). Data Processing, Structure Determination, and Refinement PsDRR206 structure was solved by molecular replacement using the homology model generated for the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP AtDIR6 from  A. thaliana  (PM0078038 ( 11 )), which was derived from an x-ray structure of  A. thaliana  AOC2 (AtAOC2; PDB code  2BRJ  ( 12 )). The sequences of PsDRR206 and AtDIR6 were aligned and the AtDIR6 model was converted into a pseudo-DRR206 model using the program CHAINSAW ( 20 ) from the CCP4 suite ( 17 ). Identical residues in the two sequences were retained, and those that differed were truncated at the Cβ atom. A weak molecular replacement solution, with a weighted  R  factor of 0.61, and a score of 0.42 was obtained with the program MOLREP ( 21 ). This solution was refined for 15 cycles using REFMAC ( 22 ) giving crystallographic  R  factor and  R free  values of 0.48 and 0.54, respectively, and 2 F o  −  F c  and  F o  −  F c  electron density maps were calculated. Inspection of the electron density showed that the molecular replacement solution was correct, with side chains truncated by CHAINSAW clearly visible in the 2 F o  −  F c  and  F o  −  F c  maps. Refinement of PsDRR206 structure was completed with the PHENIX suite of programs ( 23 ) and manual building of the model using the molecular graphics program COOT ( 24 ). Water molecules were added at structurally and chemically relevant positions, and the atomic displacement parameters for all atoms in the structure were refined isotropically. The final refinement statistics are given in  Table 1 . Atomic coordinates and structure factors for PsDRR206 were deposited to the Protein Data Bank ( 25 ) with PDB code  4REV . Superpositions were performed using the SSM procedure ( 26 ) as implemented in COOT ( 24 ) and the program LSQKAB in the CCP4 suite ( 17 ). The figures were generated using PyMOL ( 27 ). The surface topography was analyzed with CASTp ( 28 ) using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Conserved residues were mapped onto the structure using ConSurf ( 29 ). Computational Docking Experiments PsDRR206 and two ligands were prepared in AutoDockTools4 ( 30 ) with default bonded and nonbonded parameters. One ligand approximated the coniferyl alcohol quinone methide radical (CA • ), with C7 and C8 set to be trivalent, trigonal planar carbon atoms coplanar with the ring carbon and quinone oxygen atoms. A second ligand was the 8–8′ linked  bis -quinone methide. Both  syn  and  anti  isomers, referring to the relationship between C8 and the methoxyl group, were used in the docking experiments, and rotation about the C7-C8 bond was not allowed in CA • , reflecting its partial double bond character in the resonance hybrid. Flexibility was allowed for the side chains of residues Asp 40 , Phe 79 , Tyr 101 , Ser 111 , Leu 113 , Ile 161 , Thr 163 , and Leu 174 . The grid box was centered upon the ligand with sufficient size to cover the ligand, and all flexible residues and a grid spacing of 0.375 Å. Autodock Vina ( 31 ) was used to perform the docking calculations. Homology Modeling Homology models of AtDIR6 were built in SWISS-MODEL ( 32 ). RESULTS Fungally challenged pea ( P. sativum ) pods have an overall non-host disease response that includes induction of a gene called  PsDRR206  ( Disease Resistance Response 206 ), whose protein biochemical function until recently ( 7 ) was unknown ( 33 – 35 ). PsDRR206 shares 54% sequence identity with AtDIR6 over the extent of the mature polypeptide. For its study  in vitro , recombinant PsDRR206 was constitutively expressed using the strong CaMV  35 S promoter of pART17 ( 5 ). Large scale (3 liters) suspension culture of transformed tomato ( Solanum peruvianum ) cells was obtained by gradually increasing the culture volume (starter volume, 40 ml) with fresh liquid medium for 4 weeks at weekly subculturing intervals. Proteins were isolated using a series of strong cationic column chromatographic steps ( 7 ) with ∼400 μg of PsDRR206 protein obtained from the 3-liter culture. Detailed biochemical characterization next established it to be a (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP ( 7 ), and a homologue to our much earlier discovery of this protein type and its physiological function from  Forsythia  species ( 3 ). Thus we have now discovered DPs producing both pinoresinol antipodes, with the recent discovery of a (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP in  Arabidopsis  (AtDIR6) ( 1 ,  5 ). Interestingly, the function of AtDIR6 was also reported independently by others ( 6 ). Of the various DPs under investigation thus far, however, crystallization conditions have only been identified for PsDRR206, the focus of this investigation. Overall Structure PsDRR206 structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 1.95 Å resolution ( Table 1 ). The asymmetric unit contains two independent molecules related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold rotation axis and connected by a single salt bridge between Glu 169  and Arg 173 . Molecule A comprises residues 28–43, 65–105, 110–135, 138–166, and 169–184, whereas molecule B contains residues 28–42, 66–104, 109–135, 138–166, and 168–184 (see PDB code  4REV  for details). Superposition of the two independent molecules gives a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.4 Å for 124 matching Cα atoms. The structure of the PsDRR206 monomer ( Fig. 2 A ) can be best described as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-meander forming a β-barrel. The displacement (shear number) at the suture between β1 and β8, caused by twisting of the β-sheet, is ten residues. The gaps in the structure correspond to the seven N-terminal residues and loops between strands β1–β2, β3–β4, β5–β6a, and β7–β8. In all of these gaps, the electron density was either very weak or missing completely, such that the residues in the loops could not be fitted. Interestingly, the four missing loops are all at one end of the β-barrel, designated here as the top of the molecule ( Fig. 2 ,  A  and  B ).  N -Linked glycans assumed to be present at Asn 50  and Asn 120  in PsDRR206 based on their occurrence at the equivalent residues in AtDIR6 ( 11 ) are also missing in the electron density map.

Structure of the PsDRR206 monomer. \n A , ribbon representation of the eight-stranded β-barrel rainbow-colored from the N terminus ( blue ) to the C terminus ( red ), showing the secondary structure labeling.  B , the PsDRR206 monomer rotated 90° about a vertical axis and colored to show the two component β-sheets in  blue  (β-sheet 1) and  red  (β-sheet 2). The location of the domain-swapped strand β2′ from a neighboring PsDRR206 molecule making up the trimer is shown as a  transparent gray strand . The two long loops between strands β2/β3 and β6/β7 are colored  green . Alternatively, the β-barrel can be viewed as two highly curved anti-parallel sheets formed by strands β2, β3, β4, and β5 (β-sheet 1) and by strands β6, β7, β8, and β1 (β-sheet 2) ( Fig. 2 B ), respectively. Moreover, strand β6 is divided into two shorter strands such that the first part of the strand (β6a) forms the outer strand of β-sheet 2, whereas the C-terminal end (β6b) adds a fifth strand to β-sheet 1. The bifurcation of β6 occurs at a β-bulge at residues Val 145 -Thr 146 ; a similar bulge is present at the equivalent position in AOC. Analysis of the crystal symmetry shows that PsDRR206 forms a tightly packed trimer, with the trimer axis being orientated along the 3-fold axis of the H32 space group ( Fig. 3 ). Nevertheless, formation of the trimer buries almost 2500 Å 2  of surface per monomer and over 30% of the total surface of each monomer. Calculation of the electrostatic surface of the PsDRR206 monomer shows that the outer surface is hydrophilic ( left side  of  Fig. 4 A ), whereas the inner surface involved in trimer interface formation is predominantly hydrophobic ( Fig. 4 A, right side , and  B ). Along with a large number of hydrophobic contacts at the trimer interface, the monomers are also held together by six hydrogen bonding interactions (three for each monomer-monomer pair), and two electrostatic interactions (not shown). Inspection of the trimer shows that the loop between the first two strands is involved in a domain-swapping event ( Fig. 3 B ), wherein the loop does not simply reverse direction and become the second β-strand in the same monomer. Instead, it traverses the interface into the neighboring monomer, such that the N-terminal half of the first strand β2 is inserted into the second monomer next to its strand β2 ( Fig. 3 ,  A  and  B ), adding a sixth strand to β-sheet 1. The electron density in this region clearly shows the N-terminal extension of this strand ( Fig. 3 C ). This extension of strand β2 provides an additional nine hydrogen bonds, which include seven main chain interactions with strand β2 from the second monomer and two interactions with side chain atoms from the β2-β3 loop ( Fig. 3 C ). FIGURE 3. Structure of the PsDRR206 trimer. \n A , the trimer viewed down the 3-fold  c -axis of the H32 space group. The  a - and  b -axes are indicated.  B , the trimer rotated 90° about the  a -axis. One of the extended β2 strands ( blue ) traverses the trimer interface into neighboring monomer ( green ), and this region is highlighted by the  black oval. C , final 2 F o  −  F c  electron density, contoured at 1.0 σ, in the vicinity of the domain-swapped β2 strand from the  blue  monomer. This extended β2 strand makes a typical anti-parallel hydrogen bonding network with the β2 strand from the  green  monomer, along with interactions with two residues from the omega loop between strands β2 and β3 (Gln 93  and Arg 96 ). Some residues in the  blue  and  green  β2 strands are indicated. At the top of each barrel and slightly toward the outside of the trimer is a substantial pocket lined mostly with hydrophobic residues ( Figs. 4 C  and  5 ,  A  and  B ). Several conserved residues cluster around this pocket including strictly conserved charged polar residues Asp 40  and Arg 141  ( Fig. 5 A ). This narrow pocket is approximately 12 Å deep, 12 Å wide, and 5 Å across. The solvent excluded molecular surface area (Connolly surface) of the pocket is 339 Å 2 , and its volume is 463 Å 3 . FIGURE 4. Surface representation of PsDRR206. \n A , the outer (solvent exposed,  left panel ) and the inner (buried in trimer formation,  right panel ) electrostatic surfaces of the monomer.

The other two monomers making up the trimer are colored  red  and  blue , and the orientation of the trimer is a 60° rotation about the  a -axis relative to  A . FIGURE 5. Residues lining the interior of the active site pocket. \n A , several of these residues are conserved, although in only one or the other but not both of the groups of known (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs as indicated in  Fig. 1 B , suggesting a role in determining substrate orientation. The omega loop is also labeled to indicate proximity to the back side of the active site.  B , surface rendering of the active site pocket and surrounding area from the same perspective as  A , with residues shown as  sticks  in  A  now shown as  colored spheres  visible under the transparent surface. Adjacent to Asp 40  and on the opposite side of the β-sheet is found His 39 , one of three conserved residues in an unusual cluster of highly conserved residues that also includes Thr 84  and Ser 91 . The latter two residues occur in an omega loop between strands β2 and β3 that folds back upon the exterior of the barrel ( Figs. 2 B  and  5 A ). An omega loop is a nonregular secondary structure element characterized by a loop of varying structure with its N and C termini located on adjacent secondary structure elements, typically β-strands, close together in space ( 36 ). Comparison of PsDRR206 to AOC A Dali search of the PDB ( 37 ) identified several β-barrel proteins as being closely related to PsDRR206, including AOC (the first nine h",

  "discussion": "DISCUSSION The study herein obtained the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) in crystalline form, and at 1.95 Å resolution. In this regard, determination of the PsDRR206 three-dimensional structure, and its analysis suggests that the corresponding trimer has three identical substrate binding sites that are spatially distributed so that intermolecular coupling apparently cannot occur between two distinct substrate binding sites in the trimer model. Furthermore, this trimer observation is in agreement with our earlier studies ( 3 ), where the  Forsythia  DP was considered as a ∼78-kDa trimer based on gel filtration analyses, in contrast to subsequent mass spectrometric data obtained, which had suggested a dimeric protein ( 38 ). As indicated above, we also established that PsDRR206 is an eight-stranded β-barrel with the same β-meander topology and remarkably similar trimeric quaternary structure as AOC. Together with the previously mentioned low (∼17% identity), but likely meaningful, sequence similarity between DP and AOC protein families, this suggests a possible common ancestor for these functionally distinct proteins. Although there are striking structural similarities between PsDRR206 and AOC, it remains to be seen whether there are mechanistic similarities as well. Studies of AOC with and without a bound inhibitor suggested that conformational changes in the binding pocket upon formation of a tight enzyme-substrate complex precede the catalytic cycle and that steric restrictions in the active site determine the stereoselectivity of the cyclization reaction ( 12 ,  13 ). Both of these characteristics could be seen to be important in a protein guiding stereoselective phenoxy radical coupling. Conceivably, the trimeric β-barrel DP/AOC scaffold is well suited for these roles. DP Surface Features and Patterns of Conserved Residues We hypothesize that the prominent outward facing pocket near the top of each barrel is the substrate binding (active) site located within the internal cavity of the barrel, based upon comparison with the structures and similar dimensions of  P. patens  AOC1 and AOC2 with bound substrate analog (PDB codes  4H69  and  4H6B  ( 13 )). We further propose that this is the binding site for one or possibly two coniferyl alcohol phenoxy radicals (CA • ) in PsDRR206. Conserved residues Thr 163  and Phe 172  line the edge of the putative binding pocket ( Fig. 8 ,  A–D ) ( 29 ), and disordered loop residues for which electron density is missing occur around the edge of the pocket. Two polar residues, Asp 40  and Arg 141 , conserved in all pinoresinol-forming DPs but not AOCs, are also located at either end of the pocket ( Figs. 5 A  and  7 A ). The span between them is ∼12–14 Å, suitable for a single  trans  coniferyl alcohol molecule or quinone methide radical, whose lengths are ∼8–10 Å. Residues in the interior of the pocket are less conserved, however, possibly because they help determine substrate specificity. FIGURE 8. Surfac",
