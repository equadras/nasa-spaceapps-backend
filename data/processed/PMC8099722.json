  "full_text": "1 Introduction The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, which now comprises 20 national space agencies, recently published the third edition of the Global Exploration Roadmap  [1]  outlining a strategy to expand human presence in the solar system and setting the surface of Mars as a collaborative target for 2030. Safeguarding astronaut health is a critical factor in meeting this ambitious target. The Canadian Space Agency currently considers the major human health risk categories associated to space flight as: musculoskeletal (reduced muscle strength, aerobic capacity and bone fragility), sensorimotor (visual impairment), metabolic (nutritional status and sickness), behavioural health and performance (stress, fatigue, cognitive deterioration and wellbeing), radiation (ultraviolet and ionising), autonomous medical care (medical access), and physiological adaptation to variable gravity and environmental stressors (including human-associated microbial communities)  [2] . These challenges are magnified in long-duration space flight, such as during a two–three year mission to Mars, where no resupply of air, water, food or medical supplies is possible, radiation and microgravity exposure will be for longer than has yet been tested, and abortion of a mission due to crew illness will not be possible  [3] ,  [4] . While the human gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome is still being explored, it is considered essential for long-term maintenance of many aspects of human health, including healthy nutritional, immune, metabolic and psychophysiological function  [5] ,  [6] ,  [7] ,  [8] ,  [9] ,  [10] . Long-duration habitat confinement, such as that faced by astronauts during spaceflight, could interrupt the dialog between environmental microbial ecosystems and the human microbiome  [4] . Previous research has established that confined habitats subject to strict cleaning procedures on Earth, such as intensive care units and surgical theatres, as well as those in space, can produce a unique surface environment dominated by human GIT microbiome  [11] ,  [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] . The influence of confinement upon the microbiome has been studied recently in four astronauts over 60 days by Chen et al  [15]  using bioregenerative life support systems (confined and self-sufficient ecosystems). Although no common microbiome composition was observed over time they did report a potential non-significant trend of depletion of  Faecalibacterium prausnitzii  as well as large individual differences between individuals (expected in microbiome studies with very low participant numbers). Whether confinement can influence the GIT microbiome of long-term inhabitants is an important priority for future space missions  [16]  and was directly addressed in the longest-running human confined habitat experiment conducted to date, the Mars500 experiment  [17] . The Mars500 experiment isolated six astronauts within an analogue Mars-surface habitat. After 520 days, the six astronauts emerged as largely healthy, but the long-term confinement had significantly altered some of their physiology. Research conducted by Strollo et al.  [18]  measured significant decreases in total body mass (−9.3%), BMI (−5.4%) and lean (non-fat) mass (−11.8%) by day 417 of isolation. When considered alongside significant increases in fasting plasma glucose from a healthy median of 4.65 mmol/L at the beginning of the experiment to prediabetic levels of 6.02 mmol/L (impaired fasting glucose)  [19] , these findings are indicative of potential disruption in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in astronauts after extensive confinement. This aligned with significant losses of up to 22% of quadriceps/hamstring strength in astronauts, observed by Gaffney et al.  [20] . In parallel, Roda et al.  [21]  observed that the loss of body mass was accompanied by a significant increase in the faecal protein calprotectin, the intestinal inflammation biomarker making up 60% of neutrophils (the cells which characterise intestinal inflammation  [22] ); from calprotectin negative in astronauts at the beginning of the experiment, towards varying degrees of positive by day 475. Further supporting this general trend towards an onset of intestinal inflammation, Yi et al.  [23]  directly observed a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophils in the Mars500 astronauts after the 520 days of isolation, symptoms which are commonly observed in astronauts during space flight  [24] . While Strollo et al.  [18]  hypothesised that the observed symptoms accompanied by an increase in calprotectin in later faecal samples could be indicative of common metabolic alterations associated with intestinal inflammation, they discounted any microbiome interactions due to prior research conducted by Turroni et al.  [17] , which did not identify significant microbiome changes over time and found only 14 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, representing putative microbiome species) were shared between the six astronauts. Here, the potential for common microbiome change in the Mars500 astronauts over time is reassessed using improved 16S rRNA gene amplicon bioinformatics technology  [12]  and a common data normalisation strategy for all six astronauts. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sample collection and microbiome sequencing The Mars500 experiment was a ground-based human isolation study conducted over 520 days which aimed to simulate a manned mission to Mars  [17] ,  [20] ,  [25] . The study participants were all male and their ages ranged from 29 to 40. Faecal samples used for analysis here were taken on the days 7, 14, 21, 30 and 45 (early) and days 420, 450, 490, 504, 520 of the Mars500 experiment ( Supplementary file 1 ). Sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing approaches were not conducted in this study but are reported in  [17] . Briefly, the authors report that total DNA was isolated from faeces using a modified bead-beating and column extraction with QIAamp DNA Stool miniKit. Amplification used 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 805R (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) primers targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region and amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 300 bp paired-end). Raw sequences available in NCBI SRA BioProject PRJNA358005 or from  https://genelab.nasa.gov/ . Mars500 habitat environmental samples used for analysis were taken from surfaces using swabs on the days 14, 44, 436, 467, 496 to correspond to faecal microbiome sampling and were from the utility, medical or habitat modules ( Supplementary file 1 ). Sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing approaches were not conducted in this study but are reported in  [25] . Briefly, the authors report that total DNA was isolated from surfaces using a 552C regular ethylene oxide sterilized swab moistened with PCR grade H 2 O. Total DNA was extracted using a FastDNA SPIN Kit. Amplification used 515f (5′-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 926r (5′-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT-3′) primers targeting the V4 hypervariable region and amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 300 bp paired-end). Raw sequences were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive accession number: PRJEB21072. 2.2 Data processing Amplicon sequence reads were processed and annotated using Anchor  [12] ,  [26] ,  [27] ,  [28] . The amplicon terminology of exact sequence variants (ESV) are used in place of operational taxonomic unit as no 97% similarity clustering is used  [29] ,  [30] ,  [31] ,  [32] . Sequences were aligned and dereplicated using Mothur  [33]  and an ESV count threshold of 18 for the astronaut faecal microbiome dataset and 30 for the Mars500 habitat dataset. Annotation at family, genera or species-level used BLASTn criteria of BLASTn criteria of >99% identity and coverage to the NCBI curated bacterial and Archaea RefSeq and NCBI nr/nt databases (January 2020 versions). All annotation calls are putative despite >99% similarity, as databases are subject to change as discoveries are made and phylogenies revised. Reporting of 100% similar sequence matches to unique species is more accurate than reporting such hits at higher taxon levels  [12] ; however, all annotation should be considered as putative and interpreted with care. Differentially abundant ESVs annotated from the NCBI nr/nt database were manually assessed for quality. Annotation improvement is possible as databases improve/expand using the sequences provided with each ESV in  Supplementary file 1 . When the highest identity/coverage is shared amongst multiple different putative annotation, all annotation is retained and reported. Amplicons with low-counts (<30 or <18) are binned to high-count sequences in a second BLASTn, using a lower threshold of >98% identity/coverage. 2.3 Statistical analysis The normalisation strategy conducted by Turroni et al.  [17]  was distinct for each astronaut to allow observation of individual microbiome change in steady states  [34]  over time. While this described some unique elements of each astronaut, the strategy made observation of common OTUs challenging. Here, while the limited biological replication of 6n (astronauts) could not be altered, the variation introduced from single replicate stool sampling  [35] ,  [36] ,  [37]  could be reduced by pooling libraries from the first five samples and from the final five samples to improve representation of early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) microbiome states of the each astronaut. Samples selected to represent early and late periods of confinement were defined as the first and last set of five samples taken from all six astronauts and the libraries were pooled  in silico  per astronaut and period. These timepoints also represent the samples available for all six astronauts which best aligned with the Mars500 physiology studies measuring astronaut body mass  [18] , strength  [20] , faecal protein calprotectin  [21]  and immune responses  [23] . Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2  [38] ,  [39] , which performs well with 16S rRNA gene amplicon data and uneven library sizes  [40] . A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) < 0.1 was applied  [41] . Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample is <90% of the count in all samples and ESV counts must be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group (early or late)  [12] . Constrained ordination analysis was performed using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP;  Fig. 2 ) with the 1-dimensional constraint (early vs late) represented on the x-axis and the first axis of non-constrained ordination (multidimensional scaling) on the y-axis. This analysis was performed with the Vegan library  [42]  on R via the capscale function. 2.4 Data and code availability ANCHOR code is available at  https://github.com/gonzalezem/ANCHOR . ESV tables including relative abundance, annotation, count distribution, blast statistics, alternative database hits, and sequences are provided in  Supplementary file 1 . 3 Results 3.1 Mars500 astronaut gastrointestinal track microbiome community overview A total of 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were assembled and captured 71.78% of the total 4,837,317 amplicons sequenced, including 213 ESVs present in all six astronauts in the early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) samples alone ( Supplementary file 1 ). Amplicon lengths ranged between 439 and 466 nt. All ESVs were annotated as >99% similar sequence identity: 162 ESVs as putative species (including 14 which were ambiguous sequences to multiple species), 47 ESVs at genera-level, 34 at family-level, while 165 were poorly classified or unknown (<99% similarity to any well-characterised taxa) ( Fig. 1 ). ESVs which could be annotated at species-level had an average identity of 99.92% (135 ESVs had 100% sequence similarity) and captured 67% of counts, those annotated at genera-level averaged 99.83% identity and captured 7% of counts, whereas those annotated at family-level averaged 99.92% identity and captured 11% of counts. ESVs identified from the phylum Firmicutes were the most prevalent, making up 64% of counts, while 7% were from Bacteroidetes, 6% from Actinobacteria, 6% from Verrucomicrobia, 2% from Proteobacteria and 15% were from unknown organisms.

The size of the distal node (i.e. lowest taxonomic level for an ESV) is proportional to the total raw abundance. C) the distribution of counts across taxonomy levels, and D) the number of ESVs annotated at each taxonomy level. The ESVs which could be confidently identified as putative species with the highest relative abundance across all astronauts in the phylum Firmicutes were all Clostridia, including Agathobacter_rectalis_1 with 10.1% of total counts, Gemmiger_formicilis_1 with 3.5%, Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_3 with 3.3%, Fusicatenibacter_saccharivorans_1 with 2.5% and Blautia_wexlerae_1 with 2.1% ( Supplementary file 1 ). In Verrucomicrobia, two distinct ESVs had high relative abundance, Akkermansia_muciniphilia_1 with 3.5% of total counts and Akkermansia_muciniphilia_2 with 2.3% (both having 100% similarity to distinct strain groups, ie. JCM30893 and BSH01), whereas Bacteroides_dorei_1 had the highest relative abundance in the phylum Bacteroidetes with 1.2% of total counts. The ESVs with the highest relative abundance from the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were both ambiguous, with the amplified sequence identical between multiple species (ESVs labelled as _MS), Enterobacterales_MS_1 (sequence common to  Brenneria alni ,  Escherichia coli ,  Escherichia fergusonii ,  Shigella flexneri  or  Shigella sonnei ) and Bifidobacterium_MS_2 (sequence common to  Bifidobacterium adolescentis ,  Bifidobacterium faecale  or  Bifidobacterium stercoris ). 3.2 Significant microbiome changes identified across astronauts over time To determine whether there were common microbiome changes over time, a simplified experimental design was used to compare the first five samples (7–45 days) and the last five samples (420–520 days) taken from all six astronauts ( Fig. 2 ). When comparing early with late GIT microbiome samples taken from all six astronauts, alpha-diversity (Shannon and inverse Simpson) indices were not significantly different in estimated diversity between groups (t-tests p > 0.05). Canonical analysis of principal coordinates suggests samples separated by early and late groups ( Fig. 2 ) and multivariate analysis identified significant variance between the groups (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001). To identify which ESVs were significantly altered in relative abundance over time, differential abundance analysis was performed. Thirty-one ESVs were significantly different between timepoints, including 16 significantly enriched and 15 significantly depleted in late samples compared to early samples.

Fold change (FC log 2 ) in relative abundance of significantly different (DESeq2  [38] ) ESVs between early and late samples. +/− INF (demarcated by the dashed red line) indicates ‘infinite’ fold change, where an ESV had detectable counts in samples from only one condition. The complete ESV table including relative abundance, annotation, count distribution, blast statistics, alternative database hits, and sequences is provided in  Supplementary file 1 . (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 3.2.1 ESVs higher in relative abundance in late astronaut samples The 16 ESVs in significantly higher relative abundance in the astronauts after 420–520 days of confinement were all poorly characterised with the exception of  Streptococcus_thermophilus_1  ( Streptococcus salivarius  subsp.  thermophilus ). Five ESVs have been putatively placed at genera or family levels ( Fig. 2 ): Kineothrix_1, Lachnospiraceae_10, Ruminococcus_3, Ruminococcaceae_1 and Christensenellaceae_1. The remaining ten differentially abundant ESV are classified here as unknown (<99% similarity to previously identified taxa), although all have previously been observed as unknown bacteria at >99% sequence similarity. Kineothrix_1 and Lachnospiraceae_10 were both most similar to the  Kineothrix alysoides  strain KNHs209, with 97.50% and 98.41% similar sequence identity, respectively. The ESV Kineothrix_1 did share 100% similarity to a genome assembled from work sequencing difficult to culture (yet-to-be-cultured) microbiome species from the human GIT (uncultured Clostridium sp. isolate 2789STDY5608883)  [43] . Ruminococcus_3 is commonly observed at 100% sequence similarity (as an unknown bacteria) in human GIT microbiome studies (for example NCBI: AM275462   [44] ) and has previously been classified as  Ruminococcus  sp. strain 95 (unpublished, but most similar to  Ruminococcus bromii  YE282 genome  [45] ) although the most similar well-characterised species was the type strain  Ruminococcus bromii  ATCC 27255 (97.97% similar). Ruminococcaceae_1 and Christensenellaceae_1, although also commonly observed as unknown bacteria in human faecal samples at 100% sequence similarity, were both highly dissimilar to any known bacterial species (<94% 16S rRNA sequence similarity). The ten unknown sequences identified as significantly differentially abundant and enriched in astronauts after long-term confinement included the three ESVs, Unknown_254, Unknown_268 and Unknown_354, sharing 96–97% similarity to the known species,  Anaerocolumna cellulosilytica ,  Monoglobus pectinilyticus  and  Intestinimonas butyriciproducens , respectively. The seven remaining unknown ESVs had <90% sequence similarity to any known species but have all been previously observed as unknown bacteria (at >99% sequence similarity) in GIT samples of humans as well as other animals  [46] ,  [47] ,  [48] ,  [49] ,  [50] ,  [51] ,  [52] . Two of these ESVs, Unknown_309 (the highest in relative abundance) and Unknown_49, shared 100% sequence similarity with genomes recently assembled by Almeida et al.  [53]  in breakthrough research targeting yet-to-be-uncultured species in humans with  de novo  whole genome shotgun techniques (uncultured  Clostridium  sp. isolates UMGS1238 and UMGS1543) ( Fig. 3 ). The Unknown_309 sequence has also recently been observed (100% sequence similarity) and classified by Hynönen et al.  [54]  as the “Ct85 cluster” of uncultured GIT bacteria in mammals (AP10s.319,  LR595742.1  Ct85 type-f), alongside other ESVs present in astronauts but which did not significantly vary over time: Unknown_40 (AP07s.345 Ct85 type-d), Unknown_104 (AP07s.302 Ct85 untyped) and Unknown_38 (AP07s.190 Ct85 type-b).

  "introduction": "1 Introduction The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, which now comprises 20 national space agencies, recently published the third edition of the Global Exploration Roadmap  [1]  outlining a strategy to expand human presence in the solar system and setting the surface of Mars as a collaborative target for 2030. Safeguarding astronaut health is a critical factor in meeting this ambitious target. The Canadian Space Agency currently considers the major human health risk categories associated to space flight as: musculoskeletal (reduced muscle strength, aerobic capacity and bone fragility), sensorimotor (visual impairment), metabolic (nutritional status and sickness), behavioural health and performance (stress, fatigue, cognitive deterioration and wellbeing), radiation (ultraviolet and ionising), autonomous medical care (medical access), and physiological adaptation to variable gravity and environmental stressors (including human-associated microbial communities)  [2] . These challenges are magnified in long-duration space flight, such as during a two–three year mission to Mars, where no resupply of air, water, food or medical supplies is possible, radiation and microgravity exposure will be for longer than has yet been tested, and abortion of a mission due to crew illness will not be possible  [3] ,  [4] . While the human gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome is still being explored, it is considered essential for long-term maintenance of many aspects of human health, including healthy nutritional, immune, metabolic and psychophysiological function  [5] ,  [6] ,  [7] ,  [8] ,  [9] ,  [10] . Long-duration habitat confinement, such as that faced by astronauts during spaceflight, could interrupt the dialog between environmental microbial ecosystems and the human microbiome  [4] . Previous research has established that confined habitats subject to strict cleaning procedures on Earth, such as intensive care units and surgical theatres, as well as those in space, can produce a unique surface environment dominated by human GIT microbiome  [11] ,  [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] . The influence of confinement upon the microbiome has been studied recently in four astronauts over 60 days by Chen et al  [15]  using bioregenerative life support systems (confined and self-sufficient ecosystems). Although no common microbiome composition was observed over time they did report a potential non-significant trend of depletion of  Faecalibacterium prausnitzii  as well as large individual differences between individuals (expected in microbiome studies with very low participant numbers).

  "discussion": "4 Discussion 4.1 Mars500 astronaut gastrointestinal track microbiome community overview Recent metagenomic studies indicate that the majority of gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome members are still unknown or uncharacterised species  [53] . It is therefore not surprising that over half of the ESVs identified across the astronauts were uncharacterised ( Fig. 1 ). This complexity is further complicated as substantial proportions of the human microbiome are often highly unique to individuals. The highly distinct microbiome compositions of each individual astronaut were well described by the initial Mars500 GIT microbiome research conducted by Turroni et al.  [17]  and make general patterns of microbiome change challenging to observe. The original analysis did, however, report similar phyla present across astronauts, including: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia (although present in all astronauts, bacteria from within this group were originally not detected in two astronauts) and Proteobacteria. Instead of using a distinct normalisation strategy for each astronaut to observe change in steady states  [17] ,  [34] , here, libraries were pooled from the first five samples and the last five samples to improve representation of early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) microbiome states (reducing technical noise common to single replicate stool sampling  [35] ,  [36] ,  [37] ) before all astronauts were compared directly to make statistical analysis of the common change over time more straightforward. 4.2 Enriched taxa in astronauts after long-term confinement The presence of  Streptococcus thermophilus  ( Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus ) ( Fig. 2 ) within the Mars500 habitat is not unexpected as the species is commonly used in the dairy industry and is added to yogurts as live culture to market as bestowing health benefits upon consumption (as a probiotic). Subsequent assessment of astronaut dietary reports during the experiment revealed that the Italian company Granarolo provided lyophilised ‘Yomo’ yogurts to the Mars500 project, which do indeed contain live  Streptococcus thermophilus  when sold commercially  [58] . Interestingly,  S. thermophilus  is known to be particularly resilient to the freeze-drying process  [59] , so would likely have been present for consumption as live culture in the habitat. The observed significant increase in relative abundance between early and late confinement times is also coherent as the Italian astronaut reported that the team only ate the lyophilised yogurt in the final 8 months of the experiment (during the simulated “return journey”, reported in a July 2014 interview with astronaut Diego Urbina for the Italian Space Agency’s Outpost 42: Space food in training for Mars). Research suggests that culturing can sometimes capture as low as <1% of a microbial community  [60] ; however, culture-dependent approaches could have been attempted to confirm viability here.

  "conclusion": "5 Conclusions Significant changes in the relative abundance of astronaut microbiome species occurred over the 520 days of isolation. Some enrichment of known bacteria corresponded to changes in the crew’s diet, although significant enrichment of unknown species highlights the ongoing challenge faced in understanding how complex microbiome interactions influence human health. Depletion of major anti-inflammatory gastrointestinal tract bacteria over time is consistent with symptoms associated with the intestinal inflammation and insulin resistance measured during the Mars500 experiment and sometimes observed in astronauts during long-duration space flight. Sequence comparison of the astronauts’ faecal microbiome to the Mars500 environmental microbiome revealed direct large-scale associations between the gut and environmental microbiomes, an observation made possible due to the extreme experimental confinement. Identification of significant species-level microbiome alterations which align with astronaut symptoms connects the Russian, European, Chinese and now Canadian Space Agency Mars500 studies. This initial evidence of a potentially deleterious impact of long-term confinement upon microbiome health is an important step forward in the current drive to enable long-duration spaceflight."
