  "full_text": "Background There is an urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Coronavirus is expected to infect up to 70% of the world’s population and kill millions of people  [1] . To date, the main public health strategy for limiting mortality, to reduce exposure to the virus via physical distancing, carries tremendous economic costs  [2]  and may create COVID-19 disparities, as not everyone can telecommute for work or afford to shelter in place  [3] . The main treatment strategy for limiting mortality involves ventilators, which may not be available and accessible in adequate quantities  [4] . To address need for strategies that are less costly, more equitable, and more accessible, this paper describes potential causal paths from sub-optimal hydration  before  COVID-19 infection to increased morbidity and mortality. The hypothesized mechanisms suggest potential for free or low-cost, globally applicable drinking water interventions and hydration-informed treatment (e.g. hypertonic resuscitation) to limit COVID-19 mortality. Why do people die from COVID-19? COVID-19 triggers an immune response in the lungs that is described as a “cytokine storm” in the lay press and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the scientific literature  [5] . “Inflammation spikes, and fluid and dying cells fill the lung sacs, essentially drowning the patient  [6] .” The inflammation “makes the membranes between the air sacs and blood vessels more permeable, which can fill the lungs with fluid…In severe cases, you basically flood your lungs and you can’t breathe  [6] .” Death from ARDS is strongly associated with positive total body water (TBW) balance, i.e.  body water retention \n [7]  (see  Fig. 1 \n). Fig. 1 Reproduced with permission from Rahmel et al  [7] . Mean cumulative fluid balance with 95% CI for survivors and non-survivors of ARDS until ICU day 30. Risk factors for COVID-19 death Death from COVID-19 is strongly associated with older age, male sex, and age-related chronic health conditions  [8] ,  [9] ,  [10] . The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) highlights the following risk factors: residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility, chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, serious heart conditions, severe obesity (body mass index > 40), diabetes, renal failure, liver disease, and/or weakened immune system due to cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications  [10] . In the US and United Kingdom (UK), consistent with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease disparities, ethnic minorities are at increased risk of dying from COVID-19  [11] ,  [12] . Although not specified on the CDC’s list of risk factors  [10] , given the ARDS literature (e.g. Rahmel et al.  [7] ), a propensity to retain body water when stressed or challenged is partially recognized as a risk factor for COVID-19 ARDS death. Recommendations for COVID-19 ARDS treatment explicitly aim to achieve a  negative  fluid balance of 0.5–1.0 L/d  [13] . This paper posits that attention to hydration may not only increase the success of treatment for ARDS but may also prevent the development of ARDS and positive fluid balance during COVID-19 infection, in the first place. Hypotheses Hypothesized mechanism This paper hypothesizes that, compared to people who survive COVID-19, people who die from COVID-19 have too much fluid accumulating in their lungs, in part because of chronic suboptimal hydration  before  infection with COVID-19. Chronic  hyper tonic stress causes a wide variety of metabolic and physiologic adaptations throughout the body  [14] , which alter intracellular composition and response to subsequent  hypo -osmotic challenge. Infection triggers an inflammatory response which signals body water retention and vessel dilation, creating relatively hypotonic conditions. Chronic hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia in the weeks  before  COVID-19 infection are hypothesized to result in one or more adaptations, including: • Greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection. • Lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response. • Increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space. • Reduced capacity for active transport of fluid out of the airways. • Reduced capacity for passive transport of fluid out of the airways. \n Fluid accumulating in the lungs results from an imbalance between passive and active forces driving fluid into the airspaces and mechanisms removing fluid from the airspace  [15] ,  [16] . The multiplicity of factors influencing the balance of forces suggests need for intervention strategies that attend to multiple factors, simultaneously. Evidence motivating the hypotheses Overview The rationale begins by linking the CDC’s list of risk factors for COVID-19 death with increased likelihood of suboptimal hydration, expressed in terms of hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia. Suboptimal hydration is, next, linked with each of the adaptations, listed above, by experimental, clinical, and epidemiological evidence. Metabolic intermediates or pathways that mediate effects of suboptimal hydration are identified. Experiments and clinical trials that intervene against these mechanisms and increase survival from ARDS are described. Risk factors for COVID-19 death are associated with indices of suboptimal hydration Hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia are prevalent among people who are at increased risk for COVID-19 death. In population-representative datasets, a majority of older adults have plasma hypertonicity  [17] ,  [18] . In the US, hypertonicity is significantly more frequent among males than females  [17]  and among Black or African Americans and Hispanics compared to Asians (78–79% vs 55%)  [18] . Hypovolemia is common among residents of nursing home or long-term care facilities  [19] ,  [20] . Hypertonicity is associated with chronic disease risk factors for COVID-19 death. The prevalence of hypertonicity in non-acutely ill US adults ages 51–70 years who have obesity, high waist circumference, insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, dyslipidemia, hypertension and/or metabolic syndrome is 73%, compared to 56% among individuals without any of the listed conditions, in the same age group  [18] . Systematic review of observational studies suggests that hypernatremia is consistently associated with metabolic syndrome  [21] . Animal models and observational studies implicate hypertonicity and the vasopressin-hydration system in the etiology of chronic kidney disease  [22] . Hypovolemia is an established risk factor for renal failure in the ICU  [23] . Beyond older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and metabolic syndrome, hypertonicity and/or hypovolemia are also associated with asthma, liver disease, and impaired immune function, other risk factors for COVID-19 death highlighted by the CDC  [10] . Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma is associated with hypertonicity  [24] . The pathogenesis of cirrhosis involves vasopressin/antidiuretic hormone, low effective circulatory volume and retention of sodium and water  [25] . Hypertonicity suppresses innate and adaptive immune responses  [26] . For US adults ages 50–70 years, hypertonicity doubles the risk of all-cause mortality within 3 to 6 years  [18]  and has been proposed as a biomarker of general frailty  [27] . Suboptimal hydration causes body water retention Hypertonicity, TBW deficit, and hypovolemia trigger changes in metabolism and physiology that favor cell water retention  [28]  and TBW retention  [29] . Responses to acute and chronic hypertonicity are distinct  [30] . Multiple metabolic and physiologic responses co-occur impacting multiple pathways and organ systems simultaneously  [14] ,  [30] . In free-living individuals, under conditions of daily life, adaptation to chronic hypertonicity may take weeks  [31] ,  [32] . Acute suboptimal hydration Acute extracellular hypertonicity causes water to shift out of cells following the osmotic gradient via aquaporin channels. The cell shrinkage increases intracellular solute concentrations, which activate the Na + ,K + -ATPase, Na + ,K + ,2Cl -  co-transporter and the Na + /H +  exchanger, which couple to Cl - /H2CO3, to enhance cellular osmolarity and restore cell volume  [33] . At the whole-person level, acute hypertonic shrinkage of osmoreceptor cells and/or hypovolemia activate the hypothalamic–pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Acute hypertonicity triggers release of arginine vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone, which stimulates thirst and signals the kidney to concentrate urine and reduce urine volume. Acute hypovolemia triggers the kidney to produce renin, which stimulates the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin 1 (Ang I) in the liver and the conversion of Ang I to angiotensin II (Ang II) by the angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) in multiple organs, including the lung  [34] . Ang II causes vasoconstriction and secretion of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone  [34] . Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors and stimulates renal and intestinal sodium reabsorption by upregulating ENaC and Na + , K + -ATPase. Chronic suboptimal hydration At the cell level, chronic hypertonicity shifts metabolism to favor pathways that accumulate metabolic end-products (osmolytes) of low molecular weight inside the cell. The increased osmolyte concentrations create an osmotic gradient that drives water into the cell. Hypertonic conditions alter the expression of multiple genes. Hypertonicity activates tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP), also known as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT5), which coordinates increases in the expression of organic osmolyte transporters and enzymes such as aldose reductase (AR), betaine/GABA transporter (BGT1), sodium myoinositol transporter (SMIT) and taurine transporter (TauT)  [33] . Hypertonic conditions induced by high-salt diet decrease expression of renal renin and angiotensinogen-mRNAs compared to normal- and low-salt diets  [35] . Hypertonic conditions reduce expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor that mediates aldosterone effects  [36] . Chronic hypertonicity and hypovolemia increase expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  [37] ,  [38] . At the physiological level, hypertonicity alters the levels and/or activity of hormones that depend on cell volume, such as insulin  [39] ,  [14] , and/or that regulate TBW balance, such as aldosterone. Experiments in animals and healthy humans show that hypertonicity induced by high salt diet or hypertonic infusion reduces plasma aldosterone  [35] ,  [40] ,  [41] ,  [42] ,  [43] . Crossover experiments in healthy volunteers report that infusion of 25 ml/kg of a relatively hypertonic solution (osmolarity 614 mOsm/l; tonicity 373 mOsm/l) significantly decreases plasma aldosterone relative to the same volume of a hypotonic solution (osmolarity 447 mOsm/l; tonicity 169 mOsm/l)  [43] . In controlled experiments in healthy humans, hypertonic saline infusion decreases plasma aldosterone and free water clearance  [42] ,  [44] . In healthy young men with urine osmolality over 800 mmol/kg under conditions of daily life, chronic hypertonicity and mild (<2%) TBW deficit appear associated with metabolic and physiologic adaptations that result in water retention in response to hypotonic challenge  [31] . Four weeks of sustained higher intake of drinking water (>+1L/d) is associated with a mean (SE) decrease in HOMA-IR of 2.2 (0.2) to 1.7 (0.1), a mean (SE) increase in plasma aldosterone from 111 (17) pg/ml to 143 (19) pg/ml and an average (SE) increase in body weight of +1.8 (0.5) percent  [32] ,  [31] . While significant change in body weight is not detected from one week to the next, the cumulative change over 4 weeks is statistically significant and correlated with increases in serum sodium and a muted change in water turnover  [31] . Adaptation to chronic  hyper tonicity presets for overreaction to  hypo tonic challenge Cells that have adapted to hypertonic conditions are vulnerable to over-swell or lyse if exposed to hypotonic conditions. The higher intracellular osmolyte concentrations draw water in by osmosis. The phenomenon is well-established as a complication of hyperglycemic hypertonic dehydration in diabetic patients  [45] , source of systematic error in the hematology literature  [45] , cause of neuronal excitability  [46] , and hyponatremia associated brain damage  [47] . To protect against lysis, cells adapted to hypertonic conditions release more osmolytes given acute hypotonic challenge, compared to cells maintained in isotonic conditions or cells exposed to repeated hypotonic challenge  [48] . In healthy young men with usual total water intake below 2L/d and urine osmolality above 800 mmol/kg, an acute bolus of 750 ml drinking water reduces urine osmolality by over 700 mmol/kg within 60 min. After 4 weeks of total water intake above 3L/d, the corresponding decrease in urine osmolality induced by an acute 750 ml bolus is approximately halved  [32] ,  [31] . Chronic suboptimal hydration may increase risk of COVID-19 infection Hypertonicity may increase risk of COVID-19 infection by reducing aldosterone  [35] ,  [40] ,  [41] ,  [42] ,  [43] , and/or increasing insulin resistance  [14] ,  [44] ,  [49] , which increase ACE2 receptors. The balance of ACE and ACE2 receptors regulates the RAAS. While ACE converts Ang I to Ang II, which has vasoconstricting effects, ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang-1–9 and Ang-1–7, which have opposite, vasodilating and anti-inflammatory, effects. ACE2 abundance is inversely related with aldosterone  [50] . Hypoaldosteronism is known to interrelate with diabetes and renal insufficiency for persons ages 50–70 years  [51] . In rodent models ACE2 expression is increased by diabetes and decreased by insulin administration  [52] ,  [53] . Diabetes is hypothesized to increase risk of COVID-19 infection by increasing ACE2 receptors  [54] . Chiusano et al.  [55]  propose a model for describing mechanisms involved in COVID-19 infection that implicates ACE2 receptors, in conjunction with aldosterone and conditions that predispose to ARDS and poor disease outcome. ACE2 receptors are expressed by lung epithelial cells  [34] . The spike proteins of SARS-CoV bind to ACE2 receptors  [56] ,  [34] ,  [55] . Antibodies that bind ACE2 block SARS-CoV infection  [34] . “ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for COVID-19, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease  [57] .” “We know that SARS-COV-2 is bound to ACE2 which serves as a portal of entry of the SARS-COV2 virus into cells—just as it was for the SARS and probably the MERS viruses. Theoretically, anything with increased ACE2 levels could make patients more susceptible to infection with coronavirus, and make their cases more severe  [58] .” “It is becoming evident that the RAAS system is involved in HCoV infections and presumably of high importance for their pathogenicity  [34] .” “Attention should… focus on monitoring COVID19 propensities for the …diseases or treatments that trigger ACE2 increase  [55] .” Infection creates a hypotonic challenge During infection, monocytes and macrophages secrete cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL1B) and interleukin-6 (IL6), into the circulation  [59] . Increased plasma TNF-alpha, IL1B and IL6 stimulate secretion of corticotrophin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, vasopressin and oxytocin  [60] ,  [61] , which trigger antidiuresis and increase risk of hyponatremia  [59] . Suboptimal hydration promotes an immune response like that described as a ‘cytokine storm’ Preliminary data on COVID-19 and similarities between SARS-COV2 and other betacoronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV suggest a 2-step pattern of activation of the immune system  [62] . During the type 1 IFN mediated initial step, in lung epithelial cells and macrophages, cascades of molecular events, via transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and IRF3/7, result in the production of cytokines such as IL1, IL6, or TNF-alpha. In some cases, the virus escapes the initial step, causing extra tissue damage and antibody response, which escalate subsequent immune response to the level of vicious cycle called cytokine storm  [62] ; Additional, blood-derived macrophages/monocytes are attracted, activated and lead to uncontrolled, secondary innate and adaptive (T cell mediated) responses  [62] \n . \n Chronic hypertonicity in the weeks before infection could conceivably play a role in suppressing the initial immune response to COVID-19 by lung epithelial cells. In vitro, treatment of primary human small airway epithelial cells with hypertonic saline suppresses neutrophil, monocyte, and natural killer and T cell chemoattractants, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL32, IL6 and LIF  [26] . Adaptation to chronic hypertonicity before infection may delay the arrival of neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer and T cells in the early stage of infection, allowing time for the COVID-19 virus to replicate and infect more cells. Hypertonicity is described as a “danger signal” that boosts the immune system to ward off infection without need for de novo production of mediators  [63] . Hypertonicity may amplify neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage, and T cell response. Under the controlled environmental conditions of an enclosed spaceflight simulation center, compared to a lower salt diet of 6 g/d, a high salt diet of 12 g/d for 50 +/- 10 days is associated with a marked increase in the number of monocytes and “potential risk of excessive immune response when infection occurs” in healthy young men  [64] . In a randomized, double-blind crossover study involving asthmatic patients, high salt diet for two weeks significantly increased post-exercise-induced sputum neutrophil and eosinophil differential cell counts and induced sputum supernatant concentration of eosinophil cationic protein, IL1beta, IL8, leukotriene (LT) C(4)-E(4), LTB(4), and prostaglandin D(2) compared to low salt diet  [65] . Adaptation to long-term or chronic hypertonicity may be required to magnify the immune response, as acute infusion of hypertonic saline does not significantly change the number of monocytes in young women  [66] . Effects of hypertonicity on immunity depend on the extent and duration of the hypertonic state  [67] . Effects of hypertonicity on neutrophils, T cells and macrophages in vitro and in animal models have been reviewed by Kølsen-Petersen  [67] . Chronic hypertonicity impacts immune responses via signal transduction cascades that involve NF-κB, p38 MAPK and NFAT5. NFAT5 coordinates expression of osmolytes  [33]  and augments the effect of NF-κB on critical aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses  [68] . In vitro, hypertonicity stimulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and TNF-alpha by monocytes and induces the stimulation of macrophages  [69] ,  [70] ,  [71] ,  [72] . Monocytes that produce extra TNF-alpha are distinguished as an “inflammatory subset” with potent pro-inflammatory activity  [73] . TNF-alpha induces NF-κB, thereby creating a feedback system that propagates and magnifies cytokine response  [68] . Increased extracellular osmolality also influences adaptive immunity. Hypertonic saline promotes T cell proliferation by increasing cAMP, which triggers a phosphory",
