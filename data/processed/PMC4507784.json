  "full_text": "Introduction The apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding meristemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella initials), which form a ‘stem cell niche’ (SCN) ( Supplementary Figure S1  available at  JXB  online;  Bennett and Scheres, 2010 ). Each initial cell gives rise to the different root tissues, being the outermost lateral root cap, epidermis, ground tissue (cortex and endodermis), pericycle, and the innermost vascular tissues to make up a radial arrangement of root tissues. Along the longitudinal axis, the root is composed of a distal structure [lateral root cap and columella layers derived from the columella stem cell initials (CSCs)], the SCN, proximal meristem, transition zone, elongation zone, and differentiation zone ( Perilli and Sabatini, 2010 ;  Lee  et al. , 2013 ). This cylinder-like concentric root structure is established by a balance between cell division in initials, stem cells, and meristematic cells of the proximal/distal meristems, and differentiation of these cells into diverse cell types in the elongation/differentiation zone. This balance is under the tight control of unknown QC-directed signals and environmental cues that regulate the spatiotemporal expression of master regulatory genes for cell fate determination ( Scheres, 2007 ;  Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011 ). In general, when asymmetric division of a stem cell initial occurs, the daughter cell that has contact with the QC remains as an initial cell whereas the other daughter cell—which is separate from the QC—divides to form transit-amplifying cells at the boundary of the proximal meristem ( Scheres, 2007 ;  Perilli  et al. , 2012 ). Many hormones and protein factors have been shown to be involved in the specification and maintenance of QC and stem cell identity, and the resulting determination of radial and longitudinal patterning (reviewed in  Bennett and Scheres, 2010 ;  Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011 ;  Lee  et al. , 2013 ). Among them, auxin is a major cell fate-instructive hormone that is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and CSCs at the root tip to form an auxin maximum ( Friml  et al. , 2003 ;  Blilou  et al. , 2005 ). The auxin maximum specifies the hypophysis and the QC and regulates formation of the root meristem ( Sabatini  et al. , 1999 ). The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of auxin carrier proteins including the pin-formed (PINs) ( Grieneisen  et al. , 2007 ). Antagonistic regulation of PIN phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by the pinoid (PID) protein kinase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively, directs topological patterning of PINs and the subsequent auxin flux ( Michniewicz  et al. , 2007 ). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are polyhydroxylated steroid hormones that play pivotal roles in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes ( Zhu  et al. , 2013 ). Upon binding of a BR to its receptor, brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) forms a heterodimeric complex with bri1-associated receptor kinase1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase3 (BAK1/SERK3)( Bücherl  et al. , 2013 ), and the fully activated BRI1/BAK1 complex then initiates a signalling cascade that activates the positively acting transcription factors brassinazole resistant 1/BRI1 EMS suppressor 2 (BZR1/BES2) and BZR2/BES1 to regulate expression of a wide range of genes and the subsequent plant growth and development ( He  et al. , 2005 ;  Sun  et al. , 2010 ;  Yu  et al. , 2011 ). BR-induced nuclear localization of BZR1/BES1 is crucial for BR activities ( Wang  et al. , 2002 ;  Yin  et al. , 2002 ), and this localization is dependent on the phosphorylation and 14-3-3 modification status of the BZR1/BES1 proteins ( Gampala  et al. , 2007 ;  Ryu  et al. , 2007 ;  Ryu  et al. , 2010 ). Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) is a GSK3/Shaggy-like kinase that phosphorylates BZR1/BES1, thus acting as a negative regulator of the BR signal transduction pathway ( Li and Nam, 2002 ;  Yan  et al. , 2009 ). In contrast, PP2A dephosphorylates BZR1 and abolishes BZR1 binding to the 14-3-3- proteins to activate BR-responsive gene expression and plant growth ( Tang  et al. , 2011 ). BRs regulate root growth in a concentration-dependent manner: they promote root growth at low concentrations and inhibit it at high concentrations ( Müssig  et al. , 2003 ;  Kim  et al. , 2007 ). They also play a regulatory role in the control of cell cycle progression and differentiation in the  Arabidopsis  root meristem: plants treated with BR or mutants with enhanced BR signalling, such as  bes1-D , show premature cell cycle exit that results in early differentiation of meristematic cells ( Gonzalez-Garcia  et al. , 2011 ). In addition, BRs promote QC division and differentiation of distal stem cells. In fact, the BRI1-like 3 (BRL3) signalosome complex containing BAK1 and BRL1 modulates root growth and development by contributing to the cellular activities of provascular and QC cells ( Fàbregas  et al. , 2013 ). Recently two BR transcriptional targets— brassinosteroids at vascular and organizing centre (BRAVO) and ethylene response factor 115 (ERF115)—regulating QC quiescence in opposite ways have been identified ( Heyman  et al. , 2013 ;  Vilarrasa-Blasi  et al. , 2014 ). BRAVO acts as a cell-specific repressor of QC divisions, and BR-regulated BES1 counteracts its action by directly repressing and physically interacting with the BRAVO ( Vilarrasa-Blasi  et al. , 2014 ). ERF115 induces QC cell division by acting through phytosulfokines 5 (PSK5) signalling, and BR drives QC proliferation by stimulating  ERF115  expression ( Heyman  et al. , 2013 ). Here it is revealed that BR-induced accumulation of BZR1 in the root tips and down-regulation/re-localization of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 proteins may result in changes in auxin distribution and the resulting auxin maximum area. This alteration in the auxin localization domain together with gene expression regulation of  BRAVO ,  ERF115 , and other root-regulating genes may lead to ectopic activation of QC division and suppression of CSC differentiation. It is also demonstrated that BR and the related BZR1-/BES1-mediated signalling pathways have opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in  Arabidopsis  roots in a BR concentration-dependent and a signalling molecule-dependent manner. Materials and methods Plant materials and growth conditions Wild-type  Arabidopsis thaliana  (Columbia-0, Col-0), its ethylene biosynthesis mutant  eto1-11  and BR-related mutants ( det2 ,  bri1-116 ,  bzr1-D , and  bri1-116 / bzr1-D ), and wild-type  Arabidopsis thaliana  (Enkheim-2, En-2) and its mutant  bes1-D  plants were used for QC, CSC, and columella cell (CC) phenotype analysis and root-regulating gene expression analysis.  pBZR1::BZR1-YFP  and  p35S::BES1-GFP  plants were used for BZR1 subcellular localization study and ChIP-qPCR assays. Promoter-driven reporter seeds were kindly provided by Dr Wang at Carnegie Institution for Science, USA ( pBZR1::BZR1-YFP ,  pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP , and  35S::BES1-GFP ); Dr Laux at the University of Freiburg, Germany ( pWOX5::GFP ); Dr Benfey at Duke University, USA ( pSCR::SCR-GFP ); Dr Guilfoyle at University of Missouri, Columbia, USA ( DR5::GFP  and  DR5::GUS ); Dr Friml at Ghent University, Belgium ( pPIN3::PIN3-GFP ,  pPIN4::PIN4-GFP , and  pPIN7::PIN7-GFP ); and Dr Scheres at Ultrecht University, The Netherlands ( pCo2::YFP \n H2B , and  J2341 ). The following plants were generated:  bzr1-D  x  pWOX5::GFP ,  bzr1-D  x  pSCR::SCR-GFP ,  bzr1-D  x  pC \n O \n 2::YFP \n H2B ,  DR5::GFP  x  bzr1-D , and  DR5::GFP  x  mx3  ( pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP ). These reporter seedlings were used to trace expression and behaviour of the fusion proteins under the confocal laser-scanning microscope. Seeds were surface-sterilized by sequential washing with 70% EtOH/0.1% Triton X-100 for 20min, 70% EtOH for 10min, and 95% EtOH for 10min. Seeds were dried on a clean bench and cold-treated in the dark at 4 °C for 72h. These sterilized seeds were then sown on 1/2 MS agar medium containing 0.8% phytoagar (pH 5.7) in the presence or absence of the indicated chemicals. Plants were grown in a growth chamber operating under a cycle of 16h light and 8h dark at 23–25 °C with 70% humidity. All seedlings were grown vertically. Chemicals Brassinolide (BL) and X-GLUC were purchased from Duchefa (The Netherlands) and MB Cell (USA), respectively. All other chemicals used in this report were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) unless otherwise indicated. Brassinazole (BRZ), bikinin (BK), and α-(phenyl ethyl-2-one)-IAA (PEO-IAA) were kindly provided by Dr Yoshida (RIKEN, Japan), Dr Beeckman (Ghent University, Belgium), and Dr Hayashi (Okayama University of Science, Japan), respectively. Histochemical staining For propidium iodide (PI) staining (reported in  Figs 1  and  5 ), roots were incubated for 30min in PI (5 μg/ml), rinsed, and mounted in H 2 O before confocal microscopic observation.

For evaluation of BL’s long-term effects, Col-0 plants were grown on 1/2 MS agar media for 7 DAG in the presence or absence of BL (H). To analyse expression of QC-related genes in diverse BR mutant plants, Col-0 or En-2 and their mutant plants were grown on 1/2 MS agar media for 8 DAG (I).

All qRT-PCR analysis was repeated with a minimum of triple biological replicates and the data were statistically analysed by the Student’s  t -test.  CPD  was used as a control for BR-repressed genes. (This figure is available in colour at  JXB  online.) Staining and detection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was performed according to the method of  Jefferson (1987) , with some modifications. In brief, roots were fixed in 90% acetone for 20min and infiltrated with staining buffer [0.1M phosphate (pH 7.0), 10mM EDTA, 2.5mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 ·3H 2 0, and 1mg/ml X- GLUC]. The resulting stained root tissues were then fixed and processed as described in mPS-PI staining method. mPS-PI staining was performed according to the method of  Truernit  et al.  (2008)  with some modifications to reveal cell shape, the presence of starch granules, and auxin maximum (described in  Figs 2 ,  3  and  4 ). In brief, roots were fixed in fixative (50% methanol and 10% acetic acid) and then incubated in 1% periodic acid after rinsing with water. Next, the tissues were treated with modified Pseudo Schiff reagent (100mM sodium metabisulphite and 0.15N HCl, supplemented with freshly added PI to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml). The samples were transferred onto microscope slides and covered with a chloral hydrate solution (4g chloral hydrate, 1ml glycerol, and 2ml water) for 5min to observe fluorescence or reflection signals using the Zeiss Confocal microscope.

(This figure is available in colour at  JXB  online.) Confocal microscopy PI, YFP/GFP, and GUS signals were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an argon 2 ion laser (488nm) and a He/Ne 1 ion laser (543nm). For observation of PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 543nm to collect the PI signal at 595–615nm or excited at 488nm to detect GFP signal at 493–545nm or YFP signal at 521–560nm. For observation of mPS-PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 488nm and the emission was collected at 520–720nm to detect the PI signal. The stained signal for GUS activity was obtained using the reflection mode of the confocal microscope. In this case, the excitation wavelength was 488nm, and the reflection signal was collected at 485–491nm. Images were compiled and analysed using the LSM 710 ZEN image browser software. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from root tissues using the Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Intron Biotechnology, Korea) and treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed by the SYBR green method using the Applied Biosystems Step One Plus System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The expression of each transcript was normalized against the amount of  UBC1  control in each sample.  CPD  was used as a control for BR-repressed genes. The results were reported as expression relative to the Col-0 mock control ( Figs 1G ,  1H ,  5A ,  5B ,  6A , and  6B ) or Col-0 or En-2 genetic control ( Figs 1I ,  5C , and  6C ). Three to five biological replicates were included in each experiment, and the data were statistically analysed using the Student’s  t -test. Primers used for the qRT-PCRs are summarized in  Supplementary Table S1  (available at  JXB  online). ChIP-qPCR assay ChIP experiments were performed as previously described with minor modifications ( Gendrel  et al. , 2005 ) using the non-transgenic Columbia-0, plants expressing native promoter-driven BZR1-GFP ( pBZR1::BZR1-YFP ), and plants constitutively expressing BES1-GFP ( p35S::BES1-GFP ). In brief, week-old seedlings were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and the chromatin DNA fragments (~500bp in length) were isolated from their nuclei of root tissues to retrieve BZR1 or BES1-binding DNA fragments using rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam, UK). The bound DNA fragments were then extracted using the Gel/PCR DNA fragments extraction kit (RBC Bioscience, Korea) and the amount of the bound DNA was measured by performing real-time PCRs with the primer sets listed in  Supplementary Table S2  (available at  JXB  online) using equal amounts of DNA from the input and the CoIP fractions. Results Both BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways stimulate mitotic reactivation of QC cells The QC is the source of stem cell initials and is maintained at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint and thus divides infrequently ( Jiang and Feldman, 2005 ). BR-induced nuclear localization of BES1, a positive regulator of the BR signalling pathways, in the QC promotes QC reactivation, leading to production of two layers of QC cells ( Gonzalez-Garcia  et al. , 2011 ;  Heyman  et al. , 2013 ;  Vilarrasa-Blasi  et al. , 2014 ) and results in CSC differentiation ( Gonzalez-Garcia  et al. , 2011 ). In this report, whether BZR1, a BES1 homologue, is also actively involved in BR-regulated QC regulation was tested. BZR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of epidermal cells and some cortex cells of the proximal root tips of  pBZR1:BZR1-YFP  plants when they are grown in medium lacking BL (a type of BR) ( Fig. 1A ). It was found that, contrary to a previous report ( Vilarrasa-Blasi  et al. , 2014 ), supplying BL in the medium enhanced nuclear localization of BZR1 in the cells of the SCN area, so that concentrated nuclear expression was found in the root tip cells including the QC, cells above the QC, the CSC, and CCs ( Fig. 1A ). Similar localization of BZR1 was evident within 15min when BL was applied to 7-d-old seedlings (data not shown). This im",

  "results": "BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway alters the expression/subcellular distribution of PIN proteins resulting in proximal relocation of the auxin localization domain in roots Auxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and columella initials in the root tip where the auxin maximum is formed ( Blilou  et al. , 2005 ). Disruption of the auxin expression domain leads to defective development of the distal meristem ( Friml  et al. , 2002 ). Based on the finding that BR acts antagonistically on auxin action in the regulation of CSC differentiation, whether BR modulates the auxin expression domain (auxin maximum) was examined in the root tip using  DR5::GUS  and  DR5::GFP  plants as auxin-sensing reporters. To do this, roots were stained by performing either a GUS activity assay followed by mPS-PI staining to reveal cell walls and starch granules together with auxin-accumulating cells ( Fig. 4A ,  C ), or regular PI staining with live tissues to reveal cell walls ( Fig. 4B ). Auxin gradually accumulated from the QC to the CCs with the highest concentration at the CSC, CC1, and CC2 areas in most plants grown on MS medium without BL ( Fig. 4A ). About 35% of seedlings also showed auxin maximum at the root tip cells including the QC. Increasing the concentration of BL in the MS medium to 10 −10  M shifted this expression domain longitudinally upward so that auxin was heavily concentrated at the QC, CSC, CC1, and the proximal area. For instance, more than 80% of BL (10 −10  M)-treated  DR5::GUS  seedlings showed this pattern of auxin expression. Similarly, the  DR5::GFP  expression domain in  bzr1-D  plants and  mx3  transgenic plants ectopically expressing the mutated form of  BZR1  ( pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP ) moved to the proximal area ( Fig. 4B ). Consistent with the BL-driven proximal shift of the auxin maximum, BK treatment mimicking the BR-induced positive signalling pathway moved the auxin-accumulating domain to the proximal area, whereas treatment of the GUS reporter plants with BRZ reversed the BR effect on the maximum movement ( Fig. 4C ). Interestingly, some  DR5::GUS  plants treated with 10 −9  M BL resulted in enforced accumulation of auxin in the root tip area including the proximal zone, QC, and CCs ( Fig. 4A ). This is coincident with the finding that treatment of Col-0 plants with higher concentrations of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development compared with those induced by lower concentrations of BL ( Fig. 2A ,  D ). As expected, the gradual expression of  DR5::GUS  and correct establishment of auxin maximum were dramatically abolished in plants grown in medium supplied with NAA, in which auxin was uniformly accumulated in all root tip areas at a high level ( Fig. 4C ). Supplying BL together with the NAA in the growth medium did not reverse this tendency, thus a high amount of auxin remained through the root tip. The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of the PIN proteins ( Grieneisen  et al. , 2007 ). Specifically, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 play important roles in the positioning of auxin maximum and the following regulation of root patterning and distal meristem differentiation ( Friml  et al. , 2002 ;  Blilou  et al. , 2005 ). To examine whether BR modulates transcript expression and protein localization of PINs in the root tip area, BL was applied to the root of Col-0 and PIN reporter plants for 3h or for 7 DAG and their gene expression and subcellular protein localization was examined. Interestingly, BL differentially regulated the expression of  PIN s in a concentration-dependent manner: treatment of Col-0 roots for a short period (3h) with BR at low concentration (5×10 −10  M) greatly suppressed expression of  PIN3 ,  PIN4 , and  PIN7  genes whereas treatment with a higher concentration of BL (5×10 −6  M) resulted in enhanced expression of  PIN7  ( Fig. 5A ).

  "discussion": "Discussion A root is formed from a reservoir of undifferentiated cells, called root stem cells, in the root apical meristem. QC cells act as integrators for many processes and events that are requisites for root meristem establishment and maintenance. Previous studies proposed that QC cells might send short-range non-cell autonomous signals that help the initials remain in an undifferentiated state ( van den Berg  et al. , 1997 ;  Scheres, 2007 ). CSC initials and the differentiated columella cells are longitudinally adjacent to the QC. Results presented here showed that BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways acted differentially in the regulation of the QC and CSC differentiation (see  Supplementary Figure S3  at  JXB  online for a schematic model). Both pathways promoted ectopic QC cell division by down-regulating expression of  BRAVO  repressor while at the same time up-regulating  ERF115 , a positive regulator of QC division. In contrast, the effects of BRs in the regulation of maintenance and differentiation of the distal meristem were both BZR1-/BES1- and BL dose-dependent. The BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway inhibited the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying the development of starch-filled columella cells. In contrast, BRI1/BES1-mediated BR signalling showed opposite effects on differentiation of the distal meristem, as previously reported ( Gonzalez-Garcia  et al. , 2011 ). Similarly, application of low concentrations of exogenous BL (~ ≤10 −10  M) resulted in the inhibition of CSC differentiation, similar to the results of the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, while higher concentrations of BL (≥10 −9  M) stimulated CSC differentiation as observed in BRI1/BES1-mediated BR signalling. Similarly,  bes1-D  seedlings were resistant to BRZ (a BR biosynthetic inhibitor) in both dark- and light-grown conditions ( Yin  et al. , 2002 ) whereas  bzr1-D  seedlings are resistant to BRZ in the dark but are hypersensitive in the light ( Wang  et al. , 2002 ). It has also been reported that BES1 acts as a transcriptional activator while BZR1 was shown to be a transcriptional repressor ( He  et al. , 2005 ;  Yin  et al. , 2005 ). It is conceivable that differences in BZR1-/BES1-dependent signalling dynamics provide the basis of the concentration-dependent differential responses. In fact, expression of distal CSC-regulating genes, such as  FEZ  and  BRN1 , seem to be differentially regulated in  bzr1-D  and  bes1-D  plants. BRs interact with multiple hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of root growth and development ( Lee  et al. , 2013 ;  Zhu  et al. , 2013  for review). Regarding the interaction with auxin, BRs act synergistically with auxin to promote lateral root development by increasing acropetal auxin transport ( Bao  et al. , 2004 ), and enhance plant tropic responses by promoting the accumulation of PIN2 from the root tip to the elongation zone ( Li  et al. , 2005 ).
