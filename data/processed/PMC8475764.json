  "abstract": "Background:  Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 ( met1-7)  and elongator complex subunit 2 ( elp2-5 )] along with a wild-type Col-0 control. Results:  The  elp2-5  plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The  met1-7  plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the  elp2-5  and  met1-7  plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in  elp2-5 . Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of  met1-7  and  elp2-5  each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in  elp2-5 . Conclusion:  Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet  met1-7  reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of  elp2-5  results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.",

The adaptability of a genotype to changing environmental conditions is therefore determined by its genome and gene activity, both of which are in turn influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation (e.g.,  Dowen et al., 2012 ;  Zhang et al., 2018 ). The APEX-04 EPEX spaceflight experiment investigated the role of specific epigenomic changes in determining the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment. DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in:  Bartels et al., 2018 ). Many terrestrial abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes that aid in the adaptation process (e.g.,  Labra et al., 2002 ;  Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010 ;  Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011 ;  Bilichak et al., 2012 ;  Colaneri and Jones, 2013 ;  Tricker et al., 2013 ;  Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015 ,  2016 ;  Hewezi et al., 2017 ,  2018 ;  Bartels et al., 2018 ;  Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2018 ;  Beyrne et al., 2019 ;  Ashapkin et al., 2020 ;  Akhter et al., 2021 ;  Korotko et al., 2021 ;  Laanen et al., 2021 ;  Villagomez-Aranda et al., 2021 ). The genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight share similarities with many documented terrestrial responses. Hallmarks of spaceflight responses include differential expression of genes involved in pathways associated with cell wall remodeling, reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen attacks, wounding, salt stress, drought stress, and hormone signaling ( Hoson et al., 2002 ;  Gao et al., 2008 ;  Salmi and Roux, 2008 ;  Blancaflor, 2013 ;  Correll et al., 2013 ;  Paul et al., 2013 ;  Zupanska et al., 2013 ;  Ferl et al., 2014 ;  Inglis et al., 2014 ;  Nakashima et al., 2014 ;  Sugimoto et al., 2014 ;  Kwon et al., 2015 ;  Schüler et al., 2015 ;  Zhang et al., 2015 ;  Ferl and Paul, 2016 ;  Herranz et al., 2019 ;  Vandenbrink et al., 2019 ;  Barker et al., 2020 ;  Califar et al., 2020 ;  Kruse et al., 2020 ;  Angelos et al., 2021 ;  Manian et al., 2021b ). Plants further respond to spaceflight with changes in DNA methylation, again similarly to the epigenetic effects that occur during terrestrial stresses. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression alterations occurred in plants grown for part of their life cycle in a satellite experiment ( Xu et al., 2018 ). Arabidopsis grown from seed on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) showed changes in specific DNA methylation contexts, with some of those changes associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs;  Zhou et al., 2019 ). The patterns of spaceflight-associated DNA methylation are organ-specific. In comparison to roots, spaceflight leaves show higher methylation levels within the protein-coding genes compared to ground controls (GCs;  Zhou et al., 2019 ). A large proportion of the genes that are differentially expressed and differentially methylated are associated with ROS signaling ( Zhou et al., 2019 ). ROS can act as signaling molecules in responses to an array of plant stressors and there is growing evidence of an interplay between ROS metabolism and epigenetic regulation during acclimation in terrestrial environments ( Huang et al., 2019 ). DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications have been reported to play a role in regulating the innate immune response and pathogen response ( Dowen et al., 2012 ;  Wang et al., 2013 ;  Yu et al., 2013 ;  Tameshige et al., 2015 ;  Jarosz et al., 2020 ). Many components of the gene networks associated with these pathogen-associated pathways are also differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight ( Correll et al., 2013 ;  Paul et al., 2013 ,  2017 ;  Sugimoto et al., 2014 ;  Kwon et al., 2015 ;  Schüler et al., 2015 ;  Herranz et al., 2019 ;  Barker et al., 2020 ;  Califar et al., 2020 ;  Manian et al., 2021a ). This commonality of terrestrial environmental responses with spaceflight responses begged the question: do plants use similar tools to regulate genes in response to spaceflight? DNA methylation in plants occurs in three main contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, C, or T). Methylation in each context is directly maintained by a distinct pathway and set of enzymes which include: Methyltransferase 1 (MET1), decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1)1, and variant in methylation in the CG context, SUVH4-deposited H3K9me2 and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) in the CHG context, and CMT2 in the CHH context ( Chevalier et al., 2005 ;  Hsieh et al., 2012 ;  Pikaard, 2013 ). In addition to these direct enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation, a number of genes indirectly affect DNA methylation through RNA intermediates. RNA-directed DNA methylation facilitates the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases. In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct  de novo  DNA methylation and maintenance of DNA methylation at asymmetrical CHH sites through the polymerase II (Pol II)-related RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V ( Matzke et al., 2015 ). In Arabidopsis, the siRNA effector ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) exists in a complex with domains rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) for methylation of the template strand for RNA polymerase V-mediated non-coding RNA transcripts ( Zhong et al., 2014 ). The Elongator complex is a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and ELP2 is the most likely subunit to interact with the siRNA machinery ( Woloszynska et al., 2016 ). To explore the effects of these two DNA methylation pathways in conditioning the spaceflight response, we chose MET1 as a representative of the proteins directly involved in methylation and ELP2 as a model regulator that affects methylation during stress responses through RNA intermediates and regulation of methyltransferases. The cytosine DNA methyl transferase gene, Met1, is directly involved in the maintenance of cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis, particularly at CG sites ( Kankel et al., 2003 ;  Rigal et al., 2016 ). MET1 is one of several methylation enzymes that also modify the epigenome of plants as part of stress responses ( Naydenov et al., 2015 ;  Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015 ;  Dhami and Cazzonelli, 2020 ). The role MET1 plays in maintaining the CG methylation profile is also important for the subsequent inheritance of those epigenomic changes ( Saze et al., 2003 ). Loss of MET1 function non-specifically enhances resistance to bacterial infections ( Kankel et al., 2003 ;  Dowen et al., 2012 ). Many of the genes differentially regulated in methylation-mutant  met1-3  lines ( Supplementary Material ,  Dowen et al., 2012 ) show a substantial overlap with genes that are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight ( Paul et al., 2013 ,  2017 ;  Zhou et al., 2019 ) including genes involved in defense, transcription, response to hormone stimulus and phosphorylation. These methylation mutant transcriptome profiles establish that differential methylation in the genome is central to facilitating stress responses in Arabidopsis ( Dowen et al., 2012 ;  Zhang, 2012 ), suggesting the hypothesis that the stress response elicited by spaceflight in Arabidopsis may also have an epigenetic component that could involve regulation by MET1. The Elongator complex is composed of six protein subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes; it acts as a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and has several unique cellular functions, including tRNA modification, DNA modification, and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity ( Nelissen et al., 2005 ;  Glatt and Muller, 2013 ;  Ding and Mou, 2015 ;  Kolaj-Robin and Seraphin, 2017 ). Although loss of any component can compromise Elongator complex function ( Ding and Mou, 2015 ) the subunits have independent activity and can also function as sub-complexes (e.g.,  Glatt and Muller, 2013 ;  Jarosz et al., 2020 ). Elongator proteins were initially identified in plants as important to various aspects of growth, development, and immune response ( Woloszynska et al., 2016 ). Elongator Proteins ELP3 and ELP2 both contribute epigenomic regulation of gene expression in response to developmental and immune response pathways in Arabidopsis. ELP3 exhibits HAT activity while ELP2 interacts with components of the siRNA machinery ( Woloszynska et al., 2016 ). In plants, siRNAs can induce cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 through RNA-directed DNA methylation (e.g.,  Xie and Yu, 2015 ), and it is by this mode of action that ELP2 regulates plant development and stress responses (reviewed in:  Jarosz et al., 2020 ). ELP2 is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g.,  Wang et al., 2013 ) and plays a role in root development (e.g.,  Jia et al., 2015 ), The role of ELP2 in plant pathogen defense is relevant to the spaceflight response in plants as many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome are also commonly associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g.,  Paul et al., 2013 ,  2017 ;  Zhou et al., 2019 ;  Barker et al., 2020 ). Functionally, ELP2 is a regulator of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and accelerates the immune responses in Arabidopsis through epigenetic modification of DNA methylation ( DeFraia et al., 2010 ;  Wang et al., 2013 ;  Silva et al., 2017 ). Deletion of the gene encoding ELP2 has substantial impact on pathogen-induced transcription ( DeFraia et al., 2010 ;  Wang et al., 2013 ;  Silva et al., 2017 ), and also impacts fundamental processes such as root development ( Jia et al., 2015 ) and auxin signaling ( Nelissen et al., 2010 ). Many of the genes differentially expressed between  elp2  mutants and wild-type plants include hallmarks of abiotic stress responses ( Zhou et al., 2009 ). Further, many of the genes differentially expressed in  elp2  mutants are also represented in Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptomes and spaceflight methylome (e.g.,  Paul et al., 2013 ,  2017 ;  Zhou et al., 2019 ). These roles for ELP2 in pathogen responses and abiotic stresses suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of the spaceflight response pathways in plants. The Advanced Plant Experiment 04 – Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EPEX) spaceflight experiment reported herein investigated the contribution of epigenomic changes in the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment, specifically the role of cytosine DNA methylation in the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis. The experiment was conducted onboard the ISS to evaluate the spaceflight responses of the methylation mutants  met1-7  and  elp2-5  compared to the Col-0 wild-type background of both mutant lines. Growth patterns, genome-wide methylation profiles, and differential gene expression profiles were used to develop an integrated assessment of the interplay of DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation in the response to spaceflight. Materials and Methods Plant Material and Experimental Design Three lines of  Arabidopsis thaliana  (Arabidopsis) were used: Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild-type (TAIR CS70000), and Col-0 mutants  met1-7  and  elp2-5  genotype. Mutants  met1-7  and  elp2-5  previously described in  Kanno et al. (2008) ,  Guo et al. (2013) ,  Wang et al. (2013) , and were kindly provided by Dr. Zhonglin Mou ( Wang et al., 2013 ). Sterilized seeds from each line were sown aseptically onto Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, United States), containing 50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented with: 0.5 × Murashige–Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 × Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, and then sealed with breathable tape (3M Micropore ® , Maplewood, MN, United States; e.g.,  Califar et al., 2020 ). Seeded plates were prepared to maintain seed dormancy with a combination of far-red light treatment and light-tight wrapping in Duvetyne TM  cloth until insertion into Veggie growth facility on orbit. Dormancy preparation details described in  Sng et al. (2014) ,  Fitzgerald et al. (2016) ,  Califar et al. (2020) . Ten plates (nine for installation in Veggie and one spare) per genotype for each environmental condition (flight and GC) were prepared for launch. The plates were stored at 4°C and remained dormant until their installation into the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS, and a comparable set was installed into the Veggie hardware in the ISS environmental simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy space center. Plants in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber) were exposed to constant light conditions of 100–135 μmoles/m 2 s PAR for 11 days before being harvested into Kennedy space center fixation tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlater TM  (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, United States). All of the plants from each plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then stowed at −80°C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The comparable GC samples were also harvested into KFTs and stored in a standard −80°C freezer. All samples were kept frozen until delivery to the laboratory for analysis. Each plate was intended as a biological replicate and kept separate in tissue preparation operations, but the mass values drove the decision to allow a combination of two plates to comprise a replicate, which resulted in a total of four biological replicates for each of the genotypes and treatments for the analyses. Leaf and root tissues from each sample were dissected using an Olympus stereo-microscope. FromBioanalyzer and quantified with the each plate, the materials from three individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and transcriptome analyses, and materials from 10 to 15 individual plants from that same plate were allocated for DNA extraction. Molecular analyses were performed on leaf and root tissues dissected from each of the three genotypes. One plate was lost, ( met1-7 , spaceflight C6) and so one of the spaceflight  met1-7  replicates was composed of plants from a single plate rather than two plates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed for the methylome analysis and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) for the transcriptome analysis. To summarize, for each genotype under each environmental condition, a total seven (spaceflight  met1-7 ) or eight (all other genotypes and treatments) plates were used to conduct WGBS and RNASeq analyses, four biological replicates for each assay. Experiment Operations for Spaceflight and Ground Controls The plates comprising the NASA APEX-04-EPEX experiment was launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10 to the ISS. NASA astronauts Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough (expedition 49/50) managed the experiment from insertion into the Veggie growth hardware to harvest ( Figures 1A,B ). Images and videos of ISS operations are collected in  Supplementary Files 1 ,  2 . FIGURE 1 On orbit operations and comparison of plant growth in both environmental conditions.

(C)  Representative examples of each of the three genotypes (Col-0 wild-type,  elp2 , and  met1-7 ) grown for 11 days in the Veggie hardware in the ISS Environment simulation chamber (ISSES) for the ground controls (top row) and grown for 11 days in Veggie on the ISS for the spaceflight environment (bottom row; also  Supplementary File 3 ). The workflow of the orbital operations was recapitulated for the GCs in the ISSES chamber with a 24 h delay. The delay enabled a precise ground replication of minor changes in daily ISS environmental parameters and crew operations scheduling. Crew operations included the de-stowing of the plates and insertion into Veggie ( Figure 1A ), daily high-resolution photography of representative plates were taken with a hand-held DSLR camera, and the harvest and fixation of the plates on the final day of growth. Photography and harvests were conducted on the maintenance work area. All plates were photographed before harvest, and representatives of each genotype presented in  Figure 1C . The complete set of spaceflight and GC photographs are supplied in the  Supplementary File 3 . The images were used to assess the growth morphology and general health of the plants. Genomic DNA Isolation and Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing Library Preparation DNA extraction was done using a modified phenol/chloroform protocol ( LeFrois et al., 2016 ) and genome-wide bisulfite sequencing was performed using a similar procedure as that described by  Wang et al. (2013) ,  Zhou et al. (2019) . Briefly, 700–1,700 ng of genomic DNA (>5 Kb in length) observed on the TapeStation Genomic Screen Tape (Agilent) was processed for sequencing library construction. DNA was transferred into 6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps (Cat# 520045, Covaris, Inc.) and sheared into an average fragment size of ∼400 bp using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic disruptor. Short DNA fragments (<100 bp) were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. 100–250 ng of clean, fragmented DNA was used for the Illumina sequencing library construction. Both the NEBNext ®  Ultra TM  II DNA Illumina construction kit (Cat# E7645S, NEB) and the Illumina-specific methylated and dual-index barcoded adaptors (Cat# E7600S NEB) were used as described in the manufacturer’s guidelines. Illumina libraries (containing methylated adaptors) were subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct kit (ZYMO Research, Cat #D5020) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting libraries were enriched by a 13–15 cycle amplification using a uracil-insensitive polymerase (EpiMark hot start Taq polymerase, NEB, Cat #M0490S). The amplified library products were separated on a 2% agarose gel from which library fragments in the 250–500 bp range were excised (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Cat# 28704, QIAGEN) and AMPure purified (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter). Gel staining was done with SYBR Safe (Life Technologies) and visualized on a blue light transilluminator (Life Technologies) to avoid UV damage to the DNA. The final libraries were quantified by the RNA concentration was determined on Qubit ®  2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States), sized on the Agilent TapeStation (DNA5000 Screen Tape) and by qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Cat# KK4824, Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an ABI7900HT real-time PCR system (LifeTechnologies). The average library size was 350 bp. Care was taken to generate WGBS libraries that were approximately the same size as the RNASeq libraries. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing Core 1 . Total RNA Isolation and RNASeq Library Construction RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was determined on a Qubit ®  2.0 Fluorometer, RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The RIN numbers of the total RNA used for RNASeq library construction are between 7.1 and 9.3. Basically, 2 μL of 1:200 diluted RNA spike-in ERCC (half amount of suggested in the ERCC user guide: Cat# 4456740) spike to 1,000 ng of total RNA followed by mRNA isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog # E7490). This was followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog",
  "introduction": "Introduction Plants cope with environmental changes by reprogramming gene expression and metabolic processes necessary for growth, development, and survival (e.g.,  Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010 ;  Sewelam et al., 2014 ;  Lopez-Ruiz et al., 2020 ). The adaptability of a genotype to changing environmental conditions is therefore determined by its genome and gene activity, both of which are in turn influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation (e.g.,  Dowen et al., 2012 ;  Zhang et al., 2018 ).

DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in:  Bartels et al., 2018 ). Many terrestrial abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes that aid in the adaptation process (e.g.,  Labra et al., 2002 ;  Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010 ;  Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011 ;  Bilichak et al., 2012 ;  Colaneri and Jones, 2013 ;  Tricker et al., 2013 ;  Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015 ,  2016 ;  Hewezi et al., 2017 ,  2018 ;  Bartels et al., 2018 ;  Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2018 ;  Beyrne et al., 2019 ;  Ashapkin et al., 2020 ;  Akhter et al., 2021 ;  Korotko et al., 2021 ;  Laanen et al., 2021 ;  Villagomez-Aranda et al., 2021 ).

  "results": "Results Col-0 and  met1-7  Exhibited a Typical Spaceflight Growth Morphology, While  elp2-5  Displayed an Unusual Spaceflight Morphology The three genotypes, Col-0,  met1-7 , and  elp2-5  each demonstrated different growth habits in response to spaceflight.  Figure 1C  shows a representative plate of each genotype grown on the ISS (spaceflight, FT) and comparable GC. Photos of all the harvested plates are presented in  Supplementary File 3 . Col-0 and  met1-7  exhibited a typical growth morphology of Arabidopsis grown in Veggie during spaceflight ( Figure 1A ). The strong directional growth light gradient in Veggie produces a negative phototropism in roots that results in root growth that largely mimics terrestrial gravitropism ( Zhou et al., 2019 ;  Califar et al., 2020 ). For both Col-0 and  met1-7  the spaceflight (FT) roots adopt a slightly randomized growth habit compared to the GCs, yet extend well away from the site of germination and the stem, and are generally negatively phototropic in response to the “vertical” orientation of the plates relative to the light source in the Veggie growth habitat. The Col-0 and  met1-7  plants presented healthy visual phenotypes, where their leaves were fully expanded and green. In contrast,  elp2-5  plants exhibit spaceflight growth patterns that were distinct from both Col-0 wild-type and  met1-7 , and did not appear to be responding to the environmental tropic cues directing roots away from the lights in Veggie ( Figure 1C ). The roots of  elp2-5  in spaceflight did not exhibit any directional growth. Instead, all root growth appeared to occur in random patterns that resulted in most of the root mass staying within 1 cm of the germinated seed. The spaceflight leaves of  elp2-5  tended to be darker, with more of the plants exhibiting reddish coloration typical of anthocyanin production. Several of the  elp2-5  leaves on each of the spaceflight plates were chlorotic. In spite of any morphological differences among the genotypes, all produced the same biomass in spaceflight as on the ground. No statistically supported differences were observed between flight and GCs in either roots or shoots, for all three genotypes ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Spaceflight Increased Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Levels in  met1-7  and  elp2-5  but Not in the Wild-Type Col-0 Plants In the GC plant leaves, the methylation level of  met1-7  was statistically lower than that of Col-0 and  elp2-5  plants in all three methylation contexts. Col-0 and  elp2-5  and plants showed similar genome-wide methylation levels ( Figures 2A,B ). In the GC plant roots, the methylation level of  met1-7  was statistically lower than that of Col-0 and  elp2-5  plants in the CG and CHG contexts. In the CHH context, there were no statistical differences in methylation among genotypes. FIGURE 2 Average genome-wide methylation level profiles in spaceflight and on the ground.  (A–D)  A comparison of the average genome-wide methylation levels (CG, CHG, and CHH) across the three genotypes is illustrated in leaves grown on the ground  (A) , roots grown on the ground  (B) , leaves grown in spaceflight  (C) , and roots grown in spaceflight  (D) . Statistical analyses were performed using two-sample  t- test with Bonferroni corrections. Bar graphs with different letters show significant differences ( p  < 0.01). In addition, Two-Factor ANOVA analyses with replication showed that the relationships between methylation contexts were dependent on the samples ( p  < 1.0E-10).  (E–J)  Average genome-wide methylation levels are shown of each genotype (Col-0 wild-type,  elp2 , and  met1-7 ) and tissue type (leaves or roots) in spaceflight (FT) and ground controls (GC). Data represent the mean of four independent samples and  ∗∗  indicate significance ( p  < 0.01, two-sample  t- test with Bonferroni corrections) difference between flight and ground controls in each of the methylation contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH).

  "discussion": "Discussion DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating stress responses and physiological adaptation in plants ( Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010 ;  Dowen et al., 2012 ;  Zhang, 2012 ;  Wang et al., 2013 ;  Yu et al., 2013 ;  Garg et al., 2015 ;  Tameshige et al., 2015 ;  Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015 ;  Zhou et al., 2019 ). Physiological adaptation to spaceflight engages gene expression changes that at least mimic several terrestrial stress responses ( Hoson et al., 2002 ;  Gao et al., 2008 ;  Salmi and Roux, 2008 ;  Blancaflor, 2013 ;  Correll et al., 2013 ;  Paul et al., 2013 ;  Zupanska et al., 2013 ;  Ferl et al., 2014 ;  Inglis et al., 2014 ;  Nakashima et al., 2014 ;  Sugimoto et al., 2014 ;  Kwon et al., 2015 ;  Schüler et al., 2015 ;  Zhang et al., 2015 ;  Barker et al., 2017 ;  Choi et al., 2019 ;  Kruse et al., 2020 ;  Supplementary Table 2 ). In addition, the first whole-genome survey of DNA methylation in wild-type WS Arabidopsis plants grown entirely in the spaceflight environment showed correlated changes in DNA methylation accompanying regulation of DEGs in spaceflight, especially in stress response genes such as those associated with defense responses and ROS signaling ( Zhou et al., 2019 ). However, such correlations do not establish a functional connection between DNA methylation and physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Therefore, two methylation mutant lines, each deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation, were grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type. The assays for response to spaceflight were overall growth and morphology, gene expression profiles, and DNA methylation profiles. The  elp2-5  plants failed to grow normally in spaceflight ( Figure 1A ). Previous experiments have shown that in the microgravity of spaceflight, plant root growth is altered compared to growth on the ground, yet when presented with directional light, roots generally grow away from the light source and establish a near normal growth pattern, and present a generally healthy-looking morphology ( Paul et al., 2012 ;  Zhou et al., 2019 ). However, the roots of the  elp2-5  plants in spaceflight did not set up this typical spaceflight directionality, as the roots did not navigate away from the germinated seed. The total biomass of the  elp2-5  plants on orbit was similar to that of the GCs ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Thus, all of the biomass of the  elp2-5  spaceflight plants was concentrated into the area very near the seed, which may accelerate the depletion of nutrients in the immediate vicinity of germination. Nutrient depletion stress is also apparent in the  elp2-5  spaceflight transcriptome. The leaves of the spaceflight  elp2-5  plants appeared to be less expanded, more chlorotic and displayed more reddish pigmentation than the leaves of the GCs ( Figure 1C ). The  elp2-5  mutants generally exhibit over-accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, which can be fu",
  "conclusion": "Conclusion Genetic factors that influence genome DNA methylation directly impact physiological adaptation to spaceflight, affecting overall growth in space as well as the specifics of the spaceflight gene response profile. Genome methylation is therefore important for spaceflight responses in much the same way as it is important for adaptation to terrestrial stresses. In particular, processes regulated by ELP2 appear critical for proper root directional development in spaceflight. The remodeling of the Arabidopsis methylome in spaceflight, together with the negative outcomes of interfering with DNA methylation, suggests that epigenetic marking is a fundamental part of environmental responses, even during novel environmental stresses outside of the evolutionary history of plants."
