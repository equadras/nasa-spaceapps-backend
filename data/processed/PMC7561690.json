  "full_text": "ANNOUNCEMENT The genus  Klebsiella  was discovered by Carl Friedlander in 1882 from the lungs of patients who had died of pneumonia ( 1 ). In infected individuals,  Klebsiella  species can populate the gastrointestinal tract and nasopharynx, surviving on mucosal surfaces, and are known for being highly virulent and resistant to antibiotics ( 2 ,  3 ). When found on Earth, this genus of bacterial pathogens has various degrees of pathogenicity, which can lead to severe breathing problems necessitating a ventilator and rapid on-site treatment ( 4 ). When exposed to space conditions, however,  Klebsiella  species might become immunogenic and thus pose a risk to already immunocompromised astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) ( 5 ,  6 ). Since microgravity and radiation in space are reported to induce multiple genetic adaptations in microbial species, such as structural modifications of the cell membrane, that can subsequently alter their virulence ( 5 ), the strains identified here might potentially pose a problem for the health of astronauts. Therefore, a genetic comparison is necessary to provide more details on the survival of  Klebsiella  species, which have gained more attention because classical  Klebsiella pneumoniae  and its hypervirulent pathotype are becoming increasingly resistant to various antibiotics, such as carbapenems ( 3 ,  4 ,  7 ). The pathogenicity and resistance of the members of the genus  Klebsiella  might potentially create a problem for space travel, specifically for the safety of astronauts. Several strains of  Klebsiella  species, including  K. aerogenes  ( n  = 1),  K. pneumoniae  ( n  = 1), and  K. quasipneumoniae  ( n  = 8), were isolated from various locations on ISS environmental surfaces ( 8 ). The flight number, location, and other sampling characteristics of the ISS  Klebsiella  isolates are detailed in  Table 1 . Briefly, the environmental samples collected from the ISS and subsequently brought down to Earth at room temperature were aseptically handled according to established procedures ( 8 ), and 100-μl aliquots of concentrated samples were spread onto either Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) agar (25°C for 7 days) or blood agar (37°C for 2 days) for isolation of microorganisms. After morphological observation, pure colonies were archived at −80°C until further analyses. Cultures of the 10  Klebsiella  strains were grown overnight on tryptic soy agar at 25°C until harvesting and DNA extraction using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Magbead kit.

Bacterial species identity was determined when the queried sequence showed >97.5% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain. The whole-genome sequence of the nearest neighbor listed was selected for ANI evaluation. b ANI calculations were carried out using the EZBioCloud ANI calculator ( https://www.ezbiocloud.net/tools/ani ) by comparing with the listed type strain. c Hyphenated designations indicate the flight number followed by the location; for example, F3-7 indicates flight 3 and location 7. d WHC, waste and hygiene compartment; ARED, advanced resistive exercise device; PMM, permanent multipurpose module port 1. Genomes were sequenced using the Illumina (San Diego, CA) Nextera Flex protocol for library preparation, and a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell (paired end, 2 × 150 bp) was used for paired-end sequencing. The quality was assessed with FastQC (v0.11.7) ( 9 ). Adapter trimming and quality filtering were then carried out with fastp (v0.20.0) ( 10 ). After quality control, the sequences were assembled using SPAdes (v3.11.1) ( 11 ). To assess the quality of the final sequences, a QUAST (v5.0.2) analysis ( 12 ) was performed to check the  N 50  values, the number of contigs, and the total genome length ( Table 1 ). The GC contents are 54.96% for  K. aerogenes , 57.25% for  K. pneumoniae , and 58.11 to 58.13% for  K. quasipneumoniae . The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the  Klebsiella  strains were compared to find the nearest neighbor, and phylogenic characterization was determined by calculating the average nucleotide identity (ANI) using the EZBioCloud calculator ( 13 ), in comparison with the respective type strains ( K. aerogenes  ATCC 13048 T ,  K. pneumoniae  ATCC 13883 T , and  K. quasipneumoniae  01A030 T ). Default parameters were used for all software. Data availability.
