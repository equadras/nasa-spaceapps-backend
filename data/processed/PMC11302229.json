  "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the wild,  C. elegans  are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable menagerie of microorganisms. The  C. elegans  cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes from  C. elegans  natural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple “skin microbiome.” We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the  C. elegans  surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, including  Enterobacter  sp. JUb101 ,  are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others like  Stenotrophomonas indicatrix  JUb19 and  Ochrobactrum vermis  MYb71 are predominantly found in the animal’s gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts. IMPORTANCE The genetic model organism  C. elegans  has recently emerged as a tool for understanding host–microbiome interactions. Nearly all of these studies either focus on pathogenic or gut-resident microbes. Little is known about the existence of native, nonpathogenic skin microbes or their function. We demonstrate that members of a modified  C. elegans  model microbiome, mCeMbio, can adhere to the animal's cuticle and confer protection from noxious environments. We combine a novel micro-swab tool, the first 16S microbial sequencing data from relatively unperturbed  C. elegans , and physiological assays to demonstrate microbially mediated protection of the skin. This work serves as a foundation to explore wild  C. elegans  skin microbiomes and use  C. elegans  as a model for skin research.",

Microbiomes play a significant role in shaping host physiology, adaptation, fitness, and even behavior ( 1 – 4 ). Organisms and their microbial inhabitants share their first interactions at the integument of the host ( 5 ). This enveloping layer, whether it be skin, membranes, or a cuticle, plays an essential role in host–microbe relationships and may act as a barrier to promote host survival. These essential roles coupled with dynamic microbial communities provide a valuable interface to study host–microbe interactions ( 6 ). Emerging studies specifically focus on the effects of single, pathogenic bacteria, which are often localized to the gut, on animal behavior and physiology ( 7 – 10 ). Although single-species studies allow a thorough investigation of host–microbe interactions, individual microbial species do not fully recapitulate entire communities of microbes ( 11 ). Moreover, a majority of these studies focus on pathogen invasion mechanisms of the skin or pathogen–commensal microbial interactions ( 12 ), whereas host–commensal dynamics at the skin surface remain impactful but understudied ( 5 ,  13 ). This is also the case for the soil- and fruit-dwelling nematode,  Caenorhabditis elegans . Despite the subtle implication of surface-adherent bacteria, host–microbe interaction studies at the surface layer are often focused on pathogens ( 14 – 16 ). In the wild,  C. elegans  are found in rotting organic matter filled with microorganisms ( 17 – 19 ). Therefore, an interaction between external microbes and the worm’s integument—the cuticle—is inevitable and likely a dynamic process ( 20 ), Moreover, these nematodes rely on their cuticle health to protect against environmental stressors such as harmful toxins ( 21 ), desiccants ( 22 ), or pathogens ( 23 ,  24 ). The function of the  C. elegans  cuticle and its many structures have been explored using mutants in the underlying genes. Animals with defective cuticle structures display a number of phenotypes including motor abnormalities, a higher susceptibility to chemically induced cuticle degradation, and protection from skin pathogens ( 25 – 28 ). Several modes of fungal and single-bacterial adherence and pathogenesis have been characterized ( 14 – 16 ), including  Leucobacter  strains known to externally invade  C. elegans  surfaces ( 15 ,  29 ). However, interactions involving ecologically relevant commensals and, moreover, communities of microbes that represent wild  C. elegans  encounters remain underexplored. Nematodes are maintained on bacterial lawns in laboratory settings. Together with their genetic tools and transparent bodies,  C. elegans  have recently gained attention in microbiome studies ( 30 ,  31 ). In the laboratory setting, a single bacterium  Escherichia coli  (usually a single strain, OP50) serves as the animal’s food source and external environment and minimally colonizes the  C. elegans  intestine for most of its life ( 32 ). However,  E. coli  is not a substitute for a microbiome of  C. elegans  nor is it extensively associated with the nematode in the wild. A recent meta-analysis of the  C. elegans  intestinal microbiota produced a comprehensive analysis of the host’s natural gut inhabitants ( 17 – 19 ). This collaborative effort prompted the creation of the  C. elegans  microbiome (CeMbio), a model microbiome consisting of the 12 most abundant gut bacteria families naturally associated with  C. elegans  ( 33 ). Individual isolates from this consortium are known to affect growth, food choice behavior, and physiology, as well neural degradation through metabolite secretion ( 34 – 38 ). However, these studies only consider the influence and composition of CeMbio bacteria in the gut and have not examined their potential impact at other body sites, like the cuticle. In preparation for intestinal microbial sequencing, animals are traditionally subjected to harsh bleach washes and surface-sterilization protocols to remove cuticle-resident bacteria ( 39 ). Moreover, the first study using CeMbio intensified previously established washing steps to more effectively remove bacteria that were hypothesized to still remain on the surface, even after washing multiple times ( 33 ). The examination of nematode microbiomes in the absence of stringent surface bleach sterilization may provide worthwhile insights into the effects of a comprehensive, complex, and natural microbiome on cuticle physiology and host biology. To investigate the persistence, existence, and composition of a cuticle-resident microbiome, we develop a novel micro-swabbing tool in combination with bacterial growth curves to investigate if animals reared on a complex microbiome harbor cuticle-resident bacteria. To supplement this finding, we enumerate the abundance of bacteria on surface-sterilized animals to demonstrate that surface-sterilization protocols remove a significant number of skin-resident or associated bacteria. We then conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize a skin microbiome on animals reared on complex microbiomes similar to CeMbio, which we call modified CeMbio (mCeMbio,  Table 1 ). Importantly, we find that the microbiome of non-sterilized  C. elegans  is microbially distinct from the microbiome of the  C. elegans  gut and the surrounding environment. We identify skin- and gut-dominant isolates of this microbial consortium that demonstrate distinct attachment strengths to the cuticle. Finally, we show that colonization with mCeMbio and with several mCeMbio isolates confers protection for the host against noxious stimuli.

However, existing microbiological techniques on the nematode are designed to isolate the entirety of the animal’s microbiota rather than skin microbes. We postulated that the entire microbiota consists of gut-resident and surface-resident microbes and that these parts can be separated with varying intensities of surface-washing steps ( Fig. 1A ). For instance, surface-sterilization, hereafter referred to as “bleaching,” removes all skin bacteria and isolates gut-resident bacteria ( Fig. 1A ). Moreover, we hypothesize that animals with more skin-resident bacteria will demonstrate larger decreases in bacterial counts following bleaching. Using a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, we assessed the existence of surface-adherent microbes on animals reared on OP50 or mCeMbio. First, we observe greater CFUs from animals reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50 ( Fig. 1B ). We also observe no significant difference between the number of CFUs from whole animal lysates that were serially washed or bleached after being reared on OP50 (<10 3  bacteria per worm,  Fig. 1B ). However, we observe a significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (<10 4  bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>10 6  bacteria per worm). From these data, we find that animals reared on mCeMbio, but not OP50, harbor skin-resident bacteria. Moreover, to account for free-living bacteria that are not in contact with the skin, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants after a series of washes. We observe that there are OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria present in the supernatant after washing three times, which might reflect transient gut or skin microbes that have been shed, and highlight the limited extent of these methods for identifying skin-resident microbes.

Inspired by existing methods used to identify skin microbes on the surface of amphibians ( 40 – 43 ), we created a microscopic nematode-sized skin swab. This reusable glass tool is swabbed across the length of each animal ( Fig. 1C ). To eliminate non-adherent, free-living microbes and enrich for putative skin-resident microbes, we compare unwashed animals (“crawl”) to animals that have been washed once or three times. As a negative control, we include animals that have been bleached. Swabs from animals reared on OP50 indicate that OP50 grows from lawns and unwashed animals, but even washing once eliminates all skin-associated OP50 bacteria ( Fig. 1D ; Fig. S1A and C). Specifically, growth curves of OP50 from singly (1X) and triply (3X) washed animals are indistinguishable from the swabs from bleached animals ( Fig. 1E ). Swabs from animals reared on mCeMbio indicate that viable bacteria can be isolated from lawns and unwashed animals as well as animals that have been washed up to three times ( Fig. 1F ; Fig. S1B and D). Growth curves of mCeMbio from animals washed up to three times had ~7 fold higher levels of bacteria compared to bleached animals ( Fig. 1G ). These findings suggest that there are significant populations of adherent mCeMbio bacteria on the  C. elegans  cuticle that are removed by standard bleach-based surface-sterilization protocols. Surface sterilization alters the relative proportion of mCeMbio bacteria, suggesting distinct surface-resident communities We sought to define the species of mCeMbio bacteria that reside on the  C. elegans  cuticle and determine whether they are distinct from the microbiota of the gut and the surrounding environment. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on bleached  C. elegans , serially washed  C. elegans , and their bacterial lawns. In two separate experiments, we discovered that the bacterial communities of bleached animals have a microbiota that is distinct from those of animals that have been serially washed. In bleached animals, we observed significantly higher levels of  Stenotrophomonas indicatrix  JUb19 and  Ochrobactrum vermis  MYb71, while unbleached animals contain more  Enterobacter sp . JUb101 and  Sphingobacterium multivorum  BIGb0170 ( Fig. 2A through C ). Despite significant differences between the relative abundance of bacteria across experiments 1 and 2 (Fig. S2A through C), we observe consistent differences in microbiota composition of bleached and serially washed animals, both of which are distinct from bacterial lawns ( Fig. 2E and F ). These data suggest that bacterial communities of bleached animals are significantly different than those of serially washed animals, as evidenced by Bray–Curtis distances (PERMANOVA,  Fig. 2G and I ). Furthermore, within-sample alpha diversity, expressed as the Shannon index, of each treatment group is similar, but mCeMbio bacterial lawns display greater diversity than bleached or serially washed  C. elegans  in experiment 2 ( Fig. 2H and J ). Our data suggest that the composition of the  C. elegans  skin microbiome is stable over time; we observe that only one bacterial species shows a significant change in abundance between 2 and 8-day-old washed (unbleached) animals, while the microbiome composition between 2 and 8-day-old bleached animals shows reduction in only two species (Fig. S2D and E). Collectively, we suggest that the microbiota of  C. elegans  with an intact skin microbiota is distinct from the microbiota of the  C. elegans  gut and further distinct from the environment on which the animals were raised. Specifically, we hypothesize that species more abundant in bleached animals (JUb19 and MYb71) are more gut-specific, whereas species more abundant in serially washed animals (JUb101 and BIGb0170) are more skin-specific.

Specific mCeMbio microbes associate with the  C. elegans  cuticle Informed by 16S relative abundance data, we sought to identify the effects of bleaching or serial washes on animals reared on JUb19 or JUb101. JUb101 is the only predominantly skin-resident microbe on which  C. elegans  develop at similar rates to those of OP50 and mCeMbio (( 33 ) and our observations), and JUb19 is the gut-resident microbe with the highest relative abundance ( Fig. 2C and D ). As in  Fig. 1 , we performed CFU analysis on the microbes of interest in this study. We observe more CFUs from lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb101 (>10 6  bacteria per worm) than lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb19 (<10 5  bacteria per worm) ( Fig. 3A ). There is no statistically significant difference between the number of CFUs from lysates of serially washed or bleached animals reared on JUb19, although JUb19 is still found on the surface. This is indicated by ~10 4  CFU per worm found in and on serially washed animals, compared to the ~10 2  CFU per worm found in bleached animals ( Fig. 3A ). Conversely, in animals raised on JUb101, there is a statistically significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (~10 2  bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>10 6  bacteria per worm), indicating the presence of JUb101 as a persistent and abundant skin-resident microbe that is removed with surface-sterilization protocols, but not serial washes ( Fig. 3A ). To account for free-living bacteria that are loosely attached to the cuticle or transient within the worm, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants following serial washes. We observe that JUb101 and JUb19 are both present in these supernatants, but in lower abundance when compared to washed groups.

Data shown are representative of average OD 600  values from an individual experiment with  n  ≥ 5 animals for each condition. Mean with standard deviation bars displayed.

Additional experiments are found in Fig. S3A through F. ( A ) Brown–Forsythe one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons test.

To directly compare JUb19 and JUb101 as putative gut and skin-resident microbes, respectively, we swabbed animals reared on JUb19, JUb101, or CBX151. We include CBX151 ( Leucobacter celer  subsp.  astrifaciens , Verde1) as a control bacterium that is known to strongly adhere to the  C. elegans  cuticle ( 44 ). We hypothesized that the patterns observed in the growth curves of swabbed skin-resident bacteria should more closely resemble those of CBX151 and mCeMbio animals ( Fig. 1G ), whereas the patterns observed in the growth curves of swabbed gut-resident bacteria should resemble those of OP50 ( Fig. 1E ). As expected, swabs from animals reared on CBX151 grow regardless of the number of washes ( Fig. 3B ). After 72 hours of growth, no discernable differences between swabs from animals that were unwashed (“crawl”), washed once, or washed thrice after exposure to CBX151 were observed ( Fig. 3C ; Fig. S3A and B). Similarly, swabs from animals reared on JUb101 grow regardless of the number of washes ( Fig. 3D ). After 72 hours of growth, swabs from JUb101-reared animals that have been washed once are not distinct from those of unwashed JUb101-reared animals, but are distinct from those of bleached animals ( Fig. 3E ; Fig. S3C and D). Conversely, swabs from animals reared on JUb19 indicate that bacterial growth from unwashed “crawl” animals is distinct from animals washed once or thrice ( Fig. 3F and G ). Swabs from JUb19 animals washed once or thrice are indistinguishable from swabs of bleached animals ( Fig. 3G ; Fig. S3E and F). Together, the patterns observed in JUb101 growth curves resemble those of CBX151, suggesting that JUb101 is also likely a cuticle-resident microbe. CeMbio bacteria promote wildtype and mutant  C. elegans  cuticle integrity Given that mCeMbio contains both skin- and gut-resident bacteria, with variable strengths of attachment on the nematode cuticle, we sought to observe a potential role for skin-adherent bacteria. We hypothesized that bacteria associated with the cuticle (JUb101, BIGb0170, and CBX",

  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS C. elegans  strains and maintenance Strains were ordered from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and include the following: wild-type N2; CB130  dpy-8 (e130 ); VC2985  dpy-10 (gk3075 ) II; CB6627  srf-3 (e2689 ) IV; CB6177  bus-8 (e2883 ) X. All animals were grown at 20°C under standard conditions to adulthood ( 52 ). NGM plates were seeded with either  E. coli  OP50 or mCeMbio strains, unless noted of a specific bacterium. For all experiments, L4 animals are placed on lawns and removed ~12 hours later, leaving only offspring behind. Experiments are then performed on the offspring, unless otherwise noted. Culture and maintenance of mCeMbio bacteria Individual isolates of “CeMBio” bacteria, referred to as mCeMbio (gift from H. Schulenberg, available now through CGC as CeMbio, see note below in Identification of mCeMbio) and CBX151 (a gift from Marie-Anne Félix), were streaked onto LB agar plates, and individual colonies were picked and grown in LB growth media. Individual bacteria (12 mCeMbio strains, CBX151, and OP50) were allowed to grow for 2–4 days, with shaking at 4 x g at 20°C. Bacteria were maintained and prepared to OD 600  = 0.2 by dilution in additional LB or centrifuging at 1,800 x g for 5 minutes to remove excess LB to increase the concentration of slow-growing isolates. To make mCeMbio, each of the 12 bacteria were combined at equal ratios. Two hundred microliters of the bacteria was pipetted on 6-cm NGM plates and evenly spread across the agar plate using a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007–358). Bacterial plates were left to dry in a laminar flow hood for 2 days. If not used immediately, seeded plates were stored at 4°C. We maintain glycerol stocks of each bacterium at −80°C, and these were used for each new batch of each mCeMbio strain, OP50, or CBX151 bacteria. Identification of mCeMbio strain JUb101 The  Lelliottia amnigena,  JUb66, genome sequenced in Houston by Buck Samuel’s group and the JUb66 genome sequenced in Kiel by Heinrich Schulenburg’s group are different. The bacterial sample deposited at the CGC as part of the CeMbio consortium is the JUb66 from the Samuel Lab (JUb66 Houston), and the one from the Schulenburg lab is now known as JUb101. We acquired our strains from the Schulenburg lab. These two genomes have identical 16S rRNA representative sequences and the same number of 16S repeats. A whole-genome comparison of JUb66 Houston and JUb101 (formerly known as JUb66 Kiel) shows only 84% similarity. To determine the identity of our CeMbio strain, formerly known as JUb66 Kiel, we used the following PCR primers and standard NEB Taq protocols.

  "results": "RESULTS A skin swab protocol reveals that abundant mCeMbio bacteria persist on the  C. elegans  surface We sought to directly identify the existence of a resident skin microbiome on the  C. elegans  cuticle. However, existing microbiological techniques on the nematode are designed to isolate the entirety of the animal’s microbiota rather than skin microbes. We postulated that the entire microbiota consists of gut-resident and surface-resident microbes and that these parts can be separated with varying intensities of surface-washing steps ( Fig. 1A ). For instance, surface-sterilization, hereafter referred to as “bleaching,” removes all skin bacteria and isolates gut-resident bacteria ( Fig. 1A ). Moreover, we hypothesize that animals with more skin-resident bacteria will demonstrate larger decreases in bacterial counts following bleaching. Using a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, we assessed the existence of surface-adherent microbes on animals reared on OP50 or mCeMbio. First, we observe greater CFUs from animals reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50 ( Fig. 1B ). We also observe no significant difference between the number of CFUs from whole animal lysates that were serially washed or bleached after being reared on OP50 (<10 3  bacteria per worm,  Fig. 1B ). However, we observe a significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (<10 4  bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>10 6  bacteria per worm). From these data, we find that animals reared on mCeMbio, but not OP50, harbor skin-resident bacteria. Moreover, to account for free-living bacteria that are not in contact with the skin, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants after a series of washes. We observe that there are OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria present in the supernatant after washing three times, which might reflect transient gut or skin microbes that have been shed, and highlight the limited extent of these methods for identifying skin-resident microbes.

To eliminate non-adherent, free-living microbes and enrich for putative skin-resident microbes, we compare unwashed animals (“crawl”) to animals that have been washed once or three times. As a negative control, we include animals that have been bleached. Swabs from animals reared on OP50 indicate that OP50 grows fr",
  "discussion": "DISCUSSION Bacteria–host interactions are complex and known to impact many aspects of host biology. Consequently, the study of ecologically relevant bacterial communities is often traded for the simplicity of single species. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of ecologically relevant communities of bacteria and uncover a  C. elegans  skin-resident microbiome. We reared animals on a natural  C. elegans  microbiota, mCeMbio, and discovered that most of the mCeMbio bacteria can be removed by bleaching protocols, suggesting that these bacteria may reside on the cuticle surface ( Fig. 1A and B ). We observed that our surface-sterilized worm CFU counts match those in previous findings ( 33 ), whereas serially washed, unbleached worms have significantly more bacteria ( Fig. 1B and 3A ). We conjectured that there are abundant skin-resident bacteria, approximating counts from simplified arithmetic of [# unbleached CFU] – [# bleached CFU] – [# supernatant CFU] ( Fig. 1A ). To supplement this finding, we developed and implemented a novel micro-swab to isolate skin microbes from  C. elegans  cuticles. We measured the growth of swabbed OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria from  C. elegans  cuticles and observed distinct and repeatable patterns of relative growth between washing conditions ( Fig. 1D through G ); more washes are required to remove mCeMbio bacteria from the cuticle, implying that mCeMbio contains surface-adherent bacteria. We then conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing to define strain-level microbial differences among serially washed and bleached animals. From these data emerged candidate gut- ( Stenotrophomonas  JUb19 and  Ochrobactrum  MYb71) and skin-dominant bacteria ( Enterobacter  JUb101 and  Sphingobacterium  BIGb0170). Although our two independent sequencing experiments revealed different proportions of microbes (Fig. S2A and C), both experiments suggest that there are distinct communities in animals with intact microbiomes compared to those without surface microbes ( Fig. 2C through J ; Fig. S2B). Importantly, the microbiomes from animals with cuticle-adherent microbes are distinct from those of their bacterial lawns ( Fig. 2G and I ), indicating some level of selection on the surface of the cuticle. Although we cannot confirm whether the composition of the supernatant from washed animals, which is composed of loosely attached bacteria, is similar to or distinct from the environment or animal surface, we focused on the more strongly attached bacteria. We further confirmed the persistence of skin-resident microbes compared to more gut-resident microbes by measuring bacterial growth from skin swabs of animals reared on these species ( Fig. 3D through G ). We hypothesize that multiple species within mCeMbio may also associate with the  C. elegans  cuticle to varying degrees. None of the mCeMbio bacteria are known to be pathogenic, although the individual isolates demonstrate varying effects on host developmental rates ( 33 ). Given the symbiot",
