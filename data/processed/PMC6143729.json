Microorganisms have been reported to cause biodegradation of structural spacecraft components, resulting in decreased integrity of spacecraft hardware ( 2 ). Microbial infections also constitute a major health risk for astronauts, especially in closed environments where the combined stresses of sleep disruption, microgravity, and high levels of radiation may further compromise the human immune system ( 2 ,  4 ). Studies have suggested that microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance increase in response to spacecraft environments ( 5 – 7 ). Other reports have associated the abundance of filamentous fungus in indoor environments with allergies and invasive infections ( 8 ,  9 ). Additionally, fungi produce a myriad of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to environmental stressors, and while many SMs have diverse therapeutic and industrial applications, others are toxins and can have detrimental effects on human health ( 10 ). As we set our exploration sights beyond low-Earth orbit, a thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered during spaceflight is critical to the success of long-term space travel. Microorganisms inhabiting the International Space Station (ISS) are exposed to microgravity and have increased exposure to high-energy radiation as a result of being outside Earth’s protective atmosphere ( 11 ). In general, it is thought that microgravity alters biological processes by initially altering the physical forces acting on the cell and its environment. This results in decreased transfer of extracellular nutrients and metabolic by-products, causing the cell to be exposed to a completely different chemical environment ( 11 ). The inside cabin of the ISS is exposed to a complex radiation environment ( 12 ), at levels that are not fungicidal ( 13 ), permitting fungi to thrive. Radiation primarily interacts with biological systems through the ionization and excitation of electrons in molecules, and its strong mutagenic properties result in an increased rate of biological evolution ( 14 ). Further, radiation can have many harmful effects on biological systems, which results in the development of adaptive responses. Fungi inhabiting spacecraft are also forced to acclimate to reduced nutrient availability, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) routinely performs stringent microbial monitoring and remediation on the ISS ( 15 ). Aspergillus niger  was reported to be the predominant species isolated in one ISS microbial monitoring study ( 15 ), which is consistent with its frequent detection in built environments ( 16 ).  A. niger  is a melanized fungal species that is ubiquitous in nature and commonly used in biotechnology industries as a production host for citric acid and enzymes ( 17 ). Despite the recurring detection of  A. niger  in spacecraft environments, investigations into its genetic alteration and gene expression modulation under ISS conditions have not been carried out. Although  A. niger  is less pathogenic to humans than other  Aspergillus  species, such as  A. fumigatus  and  A. flavus  ( 17 ), it has been associated with ear infections and can cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients ( 18 ). This enhances the need for studies to understand how  A. niger  responds and adapts to the environment of the ISS, where microgravity might play a role in compromising the human immune system ( 2 ,  4 ). Additionally, melanized fungi are highly resistant to ionizing radiation and respond to radiation with enhanced growth and upregulation of many proteins ( 19 ,  20 ), some of which may provide important insight into the adaptive evolutionary mechanism of melanized fungal species. The objective of this study was to investigate a strain of  A. niger  isolated from surfaces of the ISS, with the aim to characterize its molecular phenotype. Although it has been well established that fungi are ubiquitous on spacecraft ( 1 – 3 ,  15 ), very few studies have been conducted to characterize fungi isolated from the ISS ( 21 ). Given that melanin production in fungi is considered an evolution-derived trait to confer radiation resistance ( 19 ,  22 ), the present study of a melanized fungus that has inhabited the ISS may reveal important insights into the key traits necessary to withstand such environments. Our work investigated differences of the ISS  A. niger  isolate from Earth isolates to better understand the characteristics of strains isolated from the space station built environment. Due to the significance of secondary metabolic processes in filamentous fungi ( 23 ),  A. niger  ATCC 1015 was used as a terrestrial reference strain for physiologic and proteomic analyses because its SM profile has been thoroughly characterized ( 24 ), and we aim to build on this work by investigating SM production in JSC-093350089. RESULTS Identification of  A. niger  sampled from the ISS. Sampling of surfaces on the ISS during microbial monitoring surveys resulted in the isolation of numerous bacterial and fungal strains ( 15 ). A strain of  A. niger , JSC-093350089, identified by morphological characteristics and verified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing, was used for this study. This strain was isolated by swabbing surface materials on the U.S. segment of the ISS. Due to the nature of this sampling method, it is impossible to know the exact duration of time that this strain was on the ISS. The 36.08-Mb genome sequence of JSC-093350089 was generated using whole-genome paired-end sequencing (WGS), which was further improved to high-quality assemblies of 223 scaffolds possessing 12,532 coding sequences and 287 tRNAs. The JSC-093350089 genome was similar in size to other  A. niger  genomes, which typically range from 34.0 to 36.5 Mb ( 25 – 27 ). To further verify the identity of JSC-093350089 and place it into the larger context of the  A. niger / welwitschiae / lacticoffeatus  clade, phylogeny was assessed using maximum likelihood ( Fig. 1 ). Of the  A. niger  strains surveyed, the ISS isolate displayed the closest phylogenetic relationship to  A. niger  ( phoenicis ). Compared to ATCC 1015, an industrial strain used for citric acid production ( 25 ), and CBS 513.88, an ancestor of the  A. niger  strains used industrially for enzyme production ( 27 ), it differed by 37,548 and 39,433 variants, respectively.

Visual characterization and growth rates of JSC-093350089  in vitro . The basic physiological phenotype of JSC-093350089 was investigated on glucose minimal medium (GMM) agar plates. Visual characterization of centrally inoculated GMM plates revealed differences in pigment distribution and colony diameter after 7 days of growth ( Fig. 2A ). JSC-093350089 colony size appeared larger, and pigment had spread to the periphery of the colony in a shorter time than for ATCC 1015. Assessment of radial growth rates revealed that the ISS strain grew at a significantly higher rate than ATCC 1015 after 3 days of growth ( Fig. 2B ).

Overview of proteome analysis. To investigate the differences in the proteomes of JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015, total protein was extracted from each strain and subjected to tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. All MS data were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer with the Sequest-HT search engine against the  A. niger  CBS 513.88 protein database (NCBI). The CBS 513.88 protein database was used because it has been extensively annotated and enabled subsequent functional analysis using the AspGD Gene Ontology (GO) Slim Mapper tool. The abundance ratios for all proteins were normalized to ATCC 1015, which resulted in the identification of 218 proteins with increased abundance and 109 proteins with decreased abundance (fold change [FC] >|2|,  P  < 0.05), in JSC-093350089, relative to ATCC 1015 (see  Table S1  in the supplemental material). Distribution of AspGD GO Slim terms among differentially expressed proteins is displayed in  Fig. 3 . Many proteins that exhibited increased abundance in JSC-093350089 were involved with carbohydrate metabolic processes (10.1% of all upregulated proteins), response to stress (9.6%), organelle organization (9.6%), and transport (8.7%). Proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, protein folding, secondary metabolic processes, and transcription were associated with only increased protein abundance in JSC-093350089, while proteins involved in cellular homeostasis were associated with only decreased protein abundance in JSC-093350089. GO Slim term enrichment analysis was conducted using FungiDB ( 28 ), which identified significantly overrepresented proteins that exhibited increased abundance in the proteome of JSC-093350089 ( Table S2 ). Significantly overrepresented GO Slim terms included carbohydrate metabolic processes (4.7% of background genes with this term), cellular component assembly (5.3%), catabolic processes (4.1%), protein complex assembly (6.4%), and response to stress (3.2%).

The proteome of JSC-093350089 revealed differential levels of cell wall modulation proteins ( Table 1 ). Conidia of  A. niger  possess a relatively thick cell wall made of a network of carbohydrates, including β-glucans, chitin, α-glucans, galactomannan, and galactosaminogalactan, with an outer cell wall layer consisting of complex melanin pigments ( 29 ). The polyketide synthase AlbA (An09g05730), which is required for the production of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin (DHN-melanin) in  A. niger  ( 24 ), was over 2-fold more enriched in JSC-093350089 than in ATCC 1015. The protein abundance of hydrophobin Hyp1 (An07g03340) was nearly 3-fold higher than in ATCC 1015. RodA, the homologue of Hyp1 in  A. nidulans , has been reported to play a role in biofilm formation and efficient deconstruction of cell wall polysaccharides ( 30 ). Its homologue in  A. fumigatus  was shown to enhance fungal virulence by masking dectin-1- and dectin-2-mediated recognition of conidia  in vivo  ( 31 ).

Differential expression was observed for a number of genes encoding glycoside hydrolases, which were identified using the CAZy database ( http://www.cazy.org/ ) ( 32 ). The starvation-induced cellobiohydrolase CbhB (An01g11660), which is regulated by XlnR ( 33 ), exhibited levels nearly 3-fold higher in the proteome of JSC-093350089 than in ATCC 1015 ( 34 ). XlnR is a transcriptional activator that regulates xylanolytic, endoglucanase, and cellobiohydrolase gene expression in  A. niger  ( 33 ,  35 ). Increased protein abundance was observed for β- d -xylosidase XlnD (An01g09960), which is also regulated by XlnR ( 35 ). Decreased protein abundance was observed for XlnR-regulated β-galactosidase LacA (An01g12150), which is exclusively expressed on xyloglucan-derived substrates ( 36 ). Similarly, XlnR-regulated endoglucanase EglC (An07g08950), which exhibits its greatest activity toward xyloglucan, also displayed decreased protein abundance ( 37 ). Other starvation-induced cell wall degradation glycoside hydrolases enriched in JSC-093350089 included α-1,3-glucanase AgnB (An07g08640) and β-glucanase Scw4 (An06g01530). Differential abundance of glycoside hydrolases involved in starch utilization was also observed. Extracellular acid α-amylase AamA (An11g03340), which plays a role in starch degradation and is regulated by starch degradation regulator AmyR ( 38 ), was present in JSC-093350089 at levels 4-fold higher than that in ATCC 1015. Four of the five enzymes in the family of GH92, which consists of mannosidases, displayed increased abundance in the proteome of JSC-093350089. These GH92 proteins included An08g08370, An13g01260, An14g04240, and An16g02910. Differential abundance of stress response proteins. Our study also revealed differential abundance of proteins involved in the stress response of  A. niger  ( Table 2 ). Heat shock proteins, including DnaK-type molecular chaperone Ssb2 (An16g09260) and An06g01610, were present in JSC-093350089 at levels 2-fold and 5-fold higher than that of ATCC 1015, respectively. An06g01610 is very similar to late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)-like Hsp12 of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and has been reported to stabilize the plasma membrane ( 39 ). Increased protein abundance was observed for the serine/threonine protein kinase Srk1 (An07g07970) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase SakA (An08g05850), which have been reported to mediate cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial function in response to oxidative stress ( 40 ). Other proteins that exhibited higher levels in JSC-093350089 included the oxidative stress protein Svf1 (An18g02900) and An02g07350, which encodes a protein homologous to group 3 LEA proteins responsible for mitigating stress-induced damage, such as protecting seeds from drought ( 41 ,  42 ). The catalase An12g10720 was present at levels 13-fold higher than that of ATCC 1015. Increased abundance was also observed for the stress response nuclear envelope protein Ish1, whose expression has been reported to increase in response to glucose starvation and osmotic stress ( 43 ).

DISCUSSION In the current study, the molecular phenotype of a strain of  A. niger  isolated from the ISS was characterized. Despite its frequent detection in built environments, this is the first investigation into the “omic” differences of an ISS  A. niger  isolate from an Earth strain. As the frequency and duration of manned space missions increase, investigations into how fungi respond and adapt to various stimuli encountered during spaceflight are imperative for the health of crew and present many economic benefits. Further, such studies provide insight into the adaptive evolutionary mechanism of melanized fungal species and the biological alterations of microbes isolated from extreme spaceflight environments. The genome of JSC-093350089 was within the genetic variation of other  A. niger  strains, suggesting that its ability to survive and proliferate in a spacecraft environment is not contingent on enhanced genetic variance. This finding is consistent with a previous report on the genetic variance of ISS  Aspergillus  isolates ( 21 ). To further understand the effect of microgravity and enhanced irradiation on fungal genomics, future studies should investigate the same strain grown under both space and ground conditions to quantify and identify any mutations that may result from life on the ISS. Additional sequencing of terrestrial  A. niger  strains will also be important to better identify the donor population of the strain and further isolate the sequence variation that is specific to ISS-derived strains. One characteristic of the ISS isolate was increased protein abundance of AlbA, a key biosynthesis enzyme involved in the production of DHN-melanin in  A. niger . While  A. niger  historically has black conidia due to its high melanin content, the  A. niger  Δ albA  mutant was reported to display a white or colorless conidial phenotype ( 24 ). This is consistent with reports that fungi isolated from high-radiation environments exhibit increased melanin production. One study found that  A. niger  strains occupying the south-facing slope of the “Evolution Canyon” in Israel, which receives 200% to 800% higher solar radiation than the north-facing slope, produced three times more melanin than did strains isolated from the north-facing slope ( 44 ). It is reasonable to presume that increased melanin production is a key adaptive response to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, as there is considerable evidence that melanized fungi are highly resistant to ionizing radiation under experimental conditions ( 19 ,  45 ). In fact, it has been reported that exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation alters its electronic properties, and melanized fungal cells exhibit increased growth rates following exposure to ionizing radiation ( 46 ). Interestingly, the ISS isolate exhibited a higher growth rate than the terrestrial strain, which is consistent with previous reports of enhanced growth in melanized fungi following radiation exposure and  Aspergillus  and  Pe",

  "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation and identification of the ISS  A. niger  isolate. Surface samples were collected from the U.S. segment of the ISS using the Surface Sampling kit (SSK) (NASA, 2011). Microbes were removed from surfaces using a swab and sterile saline solution (0.85% sodium chloride) and were transported to Earth for analyses. Materials retrieved from the swabs were subsequently inoculated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with chloramphenicol. The PDA plates were incubated at ambient cabin temperature (28° to 37°C) for 5 days. The fungal colonies that exhibited growth were further purified and stored at −80°C in sterile glycerol stock until further analyses. When required, fungal isolates were revived on PDA medium, and DNA from pure cultures was extracted (UltraPure DNA kit [Mo Bio, Carlsbad, CA]). An approximately 600-bp region consisting of ITS 1, 5.8S, and ITS 2 of the isolated fungal DNA was PCR amplified, using primers ITS1F (5′ TTG GTC ATT TAG AGG AAG TAA 3′) and Tw13 (5′ GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG 3′) ( 63 ) and following the established protocol ( 64 ). The UNITE database was used to determine the closest similarity to ITS sequences of fungal type strains ( 65 ). The identity of the ISS isolate was subsequently confirmed by WGS. Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation. Extracted DNA was sent to the Macrogen clinical laboratory (Macrogen Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) for WGS. Library preparation was carried out using the Illumina Nextera kit (random fragmentation, adapter ligation, and cluster generation) and quantified with Quant-iT double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) high-sensitivity assays. Generated libraries were sequenced with 100-bp paired-end sequencing protocols on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Raw data images were produced utilizing HCS (HiSeq Control Software v2.2.38) for system control, and base calling (BCL) was done through an integrated primary analysis using Real Time Analysis software v1.18.61.0. The BCL binary was converted into FASTQ utilizing Illumina package bcl2fastq (v1.8.4). The NGS QC Toolkit version 2.3 ( 66 ) was used to filter the data for high-quality vector- and adapter-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for high quality, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20), and 22,769,466 vector filter reads were obtained after the quality check. High-quality vector-filtered reads were used for  de novo  assembly with the MaSuRCA genome assembler (k-mer size, 70) ( 67 ). The final assembly consisted of 223 scaffolds with a total size of 36,079,011 bp (∼100×). The  N 50  scaffold length was 543,773 kb, and the largest scaffold was 1,390.254 kb. There was no random “N” joining of the contigs to maintain high assembly quality. Quality check of the final assembly was performed using the quality assessment tool for genome assemblies (QUAST) ( 68 ). The number of N’s detected was less than 12 per 100 kb, which represents very good assembly. Genome annotation was performed with funannotate ( 69 ) ( http",

The abundance ratios for all proteins were normalized to ATCC 1015, which resulted in the identification of 218 proteins with increased abundance and 109 proteins with decreased abundance (fold change [FC] >|2|,  P  < 0.05), in JSC-093350089, relative to ATCC 1015 (see  Table S1  in the supplemental material). Distribution of AspGD GO Slim terms among differentially expressed proteins is displayed in  Fig. 3 . Many proteins that exhibited increased abundance in JSC-093350089 were involved with carbohydrate metabolic processes (10.1% of all upregulated proteins), response to stress (9.6%), organelle organization (9.6%), and transport (8.7%). Proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, protein folding, secondary metabolic proc",
  "discussion": "DISCUSSION In the current study, the molecular phenotype of a strain of  A. niger  isolated from the ISS was characterized. Despite its frequent detection in built environments, this is the first investigation into the “omic” differences of an ISS  A. niger  isolate from an Earth strain. As the frequency and duration of manned space missions increase, investigations into how fungi respond and adapt to various stimuli encountered during spaceflight are imperative for the health of crew and present many economic benefits. Further, such studies provide insight into the adaptive evolutionary mechanism of melanized fungal species and the biological alterations of microbes isolated from extreme spaceflight environments. The genome of JSC-093350089 was within the genetic variation of other  A. niger  strains, suggesting that its ability to survive and proliferate in a spacecraft environment is not contingent on enhanced genetic variance. This finding is consistent with a previous report on the genetic variance of ISS  Aspergillus  isolates ( 21 ). To further understand the effect of microgravity and enhanced irradiation on fungal genomics, future studies should investigate the same strain grown under both space and ground conditions to quantify and identify any mutations that may result from life on the ISS. Additional sequencing of terrestrial  A. niger  strains will also be important to better identify the donor population of the strain and further isolate the sequence variation that is specific to ISS-derived strains. One characteristic of the ISS isolate was increased protein abundance of AlbA, a key biosynthesis enzyme involved in the production of DHN-melanin in  A. niger . While  A. niger  historically has black conidia due to its high melanin content, the  A. niger  Δ albA  mutant was reported to display a white or colorless conidial phenotype ( 24 ). This is consistent with reports that fungi isolated from high-radiation environments exhibit increased melanin production. One study found that  A. niger  strains occupying the south-facing slope of the “Evolution Canyon” in Israel, which receives 200% to 800% higher solar radiation than the north-facing slope, produced three times more melanin than did strains isolated from the north-facing slope ( 44 ). It is reasonable to presume that increased melanin production is a key adaptive response to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, as there is considerable evidence that melanized fungi are highly resistant to ionizing radiation under experimental conditions ( 19 ,  45 ). In fact, it has been reported that exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation alters its electronic properties, and melanized fungal cells exhibit increased growth rates following exposure to ionizing radiation ( 46 ). Interestingly, the ISS isolate exhibited a higher growth rate than the terrestrial strain, which is consistent with previous reports of enhanced growth in melanized fungi following radiation exposure and  ",
