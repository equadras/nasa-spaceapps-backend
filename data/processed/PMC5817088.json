  "full_text": "Introduction In contrast to the classical view that mutations are random, a growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stresses in microbes can alter both the mutation rate and the mutagenic spectrum, supplying an increased variety of mutational outputs for selection to operate on and hence shaping the evolutionary trajectory of organisms ( Nicholson and Maughan, 2002 ;  Foster, 2007 ;  Nicholson and Park, 2015 ;  Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b ). This phenomenon, dubbed Stress-Induced Mutagenesis (SIM), has been most eloquently demonstrated in the recent work of  Maharjan and Ferenci (b) .  E. coli  cells were grown in chemostats under 5 different stresses, (limitation for carbon, phosphate, nitrogen, oxygen, or iron) or in a nutrient-rich environment, and loss-of-function mutations in the  cycA  gene leading to cycloserine resistance (Cyc R ) were quantified, isolated, and subjected to fitness measurements ( Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b ). Although only 2 out of 5 stresses led to a significant increase in the mutation rate to Cyc R , all stresses resulted in distinct spectra of mutations in  cycA  conferring a variety of alterations in fitness of the resulting mutants ( Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b ). The human spaceflight environment presents its own unique set of physical stressors, including cosmic radiation, microgravity, vibration, electromagnetic fields, and altered atmospheric compositions. Numerous studies have explored how microorganisms respond physiologically to spaceflight exposure (reviewed extensively in  Rosenzweig et al., 2014 ;  Taylor, 2015 ). However, very few studies have asked whether microbial exposure to spaceflight might lead to SIM ( Yatagai et al., 2000 ;  Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ). Such studies are relevant to astronaut health risk assessment, given the role that microbial SIM may play in the emergence of antibiotic resistance or modifications to the astronaut microbiome. Long-duration human missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars are currently being planned ( NASA, 2015 ), and both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration. NASA has implemented a three-phase approach to its long-term goal of the human exploration of Mars 1 . The first phase, to be accomplished in the present-to-mid-2020’s time frame, is dubbed the “Earth Reliant” phase, focusing on research aboard the International Space Station (ISS), currently the only microgravity platform for the long-term testing of crew health systems and technologies needed to decrease reliance on Earth. To date, only two studies have been performed exploring the notion that exposure of microbes to the stresses of the human spaceflight environment might result in SIM. First,  B. subtilis  spores containing a plasmid encoding the  Escherichia coli rpsL  gene were exposed to spaceflight in space station  Mir  vs. matched ground controls ( Yatagai et al., 2000 ). The frequency of mutations in  rpsL  leading to spectinomycin resistance (Spc R ) was found not to be significantly different between spaceflight and ground control samples, but sequencing of the mutant  rpsL  genes from 25 spaceflight and 38 ground control samples showed distinct differences in the spectrum of mutations leading to Spc R  ( Yatagai et al., 2000 ). Second, the frequency and spectrum of chromosomal mutations to rifampicin resistance (Rif R ) was measured in  Staphylococcus epidermidis  cells flown aboard the ISS and compared to matched ground controls ( Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ). In this experiment the frequency of mutation to Rif R  was observed to be significantly (24-fold) greater in the spaceflight samples. Sequencing of the  rpoB  gene from 67 spaceflight and 57 ground control Rif R  mutants also showed that the spectrum of mutations to Rif R  was clearly different in the flight vs. the ground control samples ( Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ). From our previous results ( Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ), we concluded that Rif R  was a good model to investigate SIM in spaceflight for a broad variety of microorganisms. Resistance to rifampicin derives from mutations within a small region of the  rpoB  gene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase ( Wehrli et al., 1968 ;  Jin and Gross, 1988 ). This region corresponds to the Rif binding site of β ( Campbell et al., 2001 ) and is highly conserved among prokaryotes ( Severinov et al., 1993 ). Single-nucleotide substitutions in  rpoB  leading to Rif R  have been shown to alter the global patterns of transcription, and resulting phenotypes, in several bacteria including  Neisseria meningitidis, Streptomyces lividans, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and  Staphylococcus aureus  ( Hu et al., 2002 ;  Maughan et al., 2004 ;  Perkins and Nicholson, 2008 ;  de Knegt et al., 2013 ;  Colicchio et al., 2015 ;  Villanueva et al., 2016 ). It is thus possible that mutation to Rif R  could alter the response of microbes to the spaceflight environment. For the present study we chose to use as the test organism the Gram-positive bacterium  B. subtilis , which possesses several advantages as a model organism: (i) it is easily cultivated and amenable to genetic manipulation; (ii) it forms dormant spores, making it an easy system to prepare for spaceflight; (iii) it is the best-studied Gram-positive bacterium; and (iv) development of its genetics, genomics, and molecular biology is highly advanced. Thus, using the well-developed  B. subtilis  system will facilitate the investigation in further detail of any potential novel mutations isolated in  rpoB . Materials and Methods Bacterial Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions The strain used was  Bacillus subtilis  strain 168 ( trpC2 ) from the authors’ laboratory collection. Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K 2 HPO 4 , 2.5; glucose, 2.5; final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. For FL and GC experiments, glycerol was added to TSY liquid medium to 10% (v/v) final concentration, resulting in TSYG medium. As appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif; Sigma–Aldrich) was added to TSY at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL.  B. subtilis  spores were routinely prepared by cultivation in liquid Schaeffer Sporulation Medium ( Schaeffer et al., 1965 ) at 37°C with vigorous aeration. The culture was harvested when phase-contrast microscopic examination revealed that it consisted of >90% free spores, usually after 3–4 days of incubation. Sample Preparation Spores were purified by lysozyme treatment, buffer washing, and heat shock (80°C, 10 min) as described previously ( Nicholson and Setlow, 1990 ). Spores were determined by phase-contrast microscopy to be >99% free of cell debris and unsporulated cells, and were stored at 4°C in deionized water. The working suspension of spores contained 10 8  colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. Aliquots of 0.1 mL (∼10 7  CFU) of the suspension were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon Cat. No. 1007) and air-dried for 48–72 h at room temperature prior to use. BRIC Spaceflight Hardware The experiments described here utilized Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) spaceflight hardware, which has been described in detail previously ( Paul et al., 2012 ). BRIC canisters can accomodate up to six samples. In these experiments, each BRIC was loaded with 5 Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs). Each PDFU was loaded with a 60-mm Petri dish containing air-dried spores, and sterile TSYG medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use and PDFUs were assembled using aseptic technique within a Class 2 Biological Safety Hood. In the sixth sample chamber of each BRIC was placed a HOBO R temperature data logger (Onset Computer Co., Bourne, MA, United States). Post-flight asynchronous GC experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the flight experiment. Flight (FL) and Ground Control (GC) Timelines Bacillus subtilis  samples were flown on two separate experiments to the ISS, the 18th and 21st BRIC missions to space, designated BRIC-18 and BRIC-21. FL samples were launched on the 3rd and 6th SpaceX Cargo Resupply missions to the ISS (SpaceX-3 and SpaceX-6 CRS, respectively), using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. Pertinent information regarding the activity timelines of these two missions can be found in  Table  1 . Growth of samples was initiated in-flight and samples incubated for 122 h (BRIC-18) or 25 h (BRIC-21) before transfer to the onboard -80°C freezer. Frozen samples were returned to Earth in the Dragon capsule and were maintained in the frozen state until return to KSC for de-integration and further processing.

Asynchronous GC experiments were performed in BRIC canisters according to the timelines determined during the FL experiments ( Table  1 ). Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber following the temperature regimes recorded during the flights ( Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ;  Morrison et al., 2017 ) and growth was terminated by transfer to a -80°C freezer, where samples were stored until further processing. Post-experiment Sample Processing In the BRIC-18 experiment, both FL and GC BRIC canisters were transferred from storage at -80°C to a +4°C refrigerator and samples allowed to thaw completely overnight. Liquid samples in Petri dishes were recovered from the PDFUs, transported to the laboratory on ice and further processed immediately. In the BRIC-21 experiment, both FL and GC samples were recovered from BRIC canisters in the frozen state, transported on dry ice to the laboratory, and stored at -80°C for later processing. Frozen samples were then thawed on ice, resuspended and processed immediately. In all instances, cells were detached from interior plate surfaces and resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas. Resuspended cultures were transferred to sterile 15-mL conical centrifuge tubes, and the total recovered volume was measured. For viable counts, aliquots from cultures were diluted serially tenfold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h to obtain CFU/mL. To obtain the total CFU per PDFU, the CFU/mL were multiplied by the volume of liquid recovered. To select for Rif R  mutants, the remainder of each culture was concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY + Rif plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24–48 h. The frequency of mutation to Rif R  was calculated by dividing the total number of Rif R  mutants by the total number of viable cells from each sample. Individual Rif R  mutants were streak-purified on TSY + Rif plates and stored at -70°C in TSY + 25% glycerol, then processed for DNA sequencing. DNA Sequencing and Analyses Primers used for PCR amplification of two Rif R  regions of the  B. subtilis rpoB  gene are listed in  Table  2 . The corresponding  rpoB  regions were amplified directly from cells using 3 μL of culture from their respective glycerol stocks as DNA template, using the GoTaq ®  PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and the following thermal cycling conditions: 95°C, 2 min for the initial denaturation step, then 36 cycles of (95°C, 30 s; 55°C, 1 min; 72°C, 2 min), followed by a final elongation step (72°C, 5 min). PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (BRIC-18) or at GeneWiz LLC (South Plainfield, NJ, United States) (BRIC-21). Multiple  rpoB  sequences were aligned using the online Clustal Omega server 2  ( Li et al., 2015 ) to identify the position of mutations relative to the wild-type  rpoB  sequence obtained from  B. subtilis  laboratory strain 168. In order to confirm the identity of novel (i.e., never-before-isolated)  rpoB  mutations, the corresponding region of the newly sequenced  rpoB  allele was amplified by PCR from each mutant and the resulting amplicon was introduced by transformation into competent cells of Rif S \n B. subtilis  strain WN547 using standard procedures as described previously ( Boylan et al., 1972 ;  Nicholson and Maughan, 2002 ). From selected Rif R  transformants, the corresponding region of  rpoB  was again PCR amplified and sequenced to confirm that the mutation had been transferred.

Results Temperature Data in FL vs. GC Experiments Temperature data were logged at 10-min intervals during the FL and GC experiments and a summary of the data is presented in  Table  3 . A detailed presentation of the temperature data can be found elsewhere ( Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ;  Morrison et al., 2017 ). Table 3 Temperatures recorded during BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 FL and GC experiments. Mission FL GC Reference BRIC-18 25.1  +  0.12°C 24.8  +  0.16°C Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 BRIC-21 22.8  +  0.07°C 22.8  +  0.21°C Morrison et al., 2017 Growth in FL vs. GC Samples Viable cell counts were determined for both FL and GC samples recovered from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments ( Figure  1 ). Because the data was determined not to be normally distributed, it was analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells grew to average total CFU per PDFU of 3.98 × 10 6  (FL) and 1.10 × 10 7  (GC); these values were determined not to be significantly different ( Figure  1 ). Ground-based growth kinetic experiments revealed that the rather low cell yield in the BRIC-18 mission was due to the prolonged incubation time (122 h) (data not shown). For the BRIC-21 mission, an increased cell yield was needed to provide sufficient sample mass for additional antibiotic susceptibility testing ( Morrison et al., 2017 ) and RNA-seq analysis (to be published elsewhere). In ground experiments preparatory for the BRIC-21 mission, it was determined that an incubation time of 25 h resulted in higher cell yields, and that 25-h cultures were in the late-logarithmic to early stationary phase (data not shown). Accordingly, statistical comparison of the total CFU obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights uncovered that cells grew to significantly higher titers in the BRIC-21 experiment, to an average total CFU per PDFU of 1.72 × 10 8  (FL) and 2.13 × 10 8  (GC) ( P  < 0.005). As found in the BRIC-18 mission, FL vs. GC titers within the BRIC-21 mission were determined to be not significantly different ( Figure  1 ). FIGURE 1 Box plots depicting growth (presented as log 10  Total CFU) of  B. subtilis  FL (cyan and blue boxes) and GC (light and dark green boxes) samples during the BRIC-18 (left panel;  n  = 5) and BRIC-21 (right panel;  n  = 7) experiments. nsd, not significantly different (Kruskal–Wallis,  P  > 0.05). Mutation Frequencies to Rif R  in FL vs. GC Samples The mutation frequency to Rif R  was determined for both FL and GC samples recovered from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments ( Figure  2 ). Because the data were determined not to be normally distributed, they were analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.9 × 10 -6  (FL) and 7.54 × 10 -6  (GC); these values were determined to be not significantly different ( Figure  2 ). In the BRIC-21 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.11 × 10 -8  (FL) and 1.94 × 10 -8  (GC); again, these values were determined to be not significantly different ( Figure  2 ). However, statistical comparison of the mutation frequencies to Rif R  obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights revealed that cells demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of mutation to Rif R  in the BRIC-18 experiment ( P  < 0.007). Again, this may result from differences in the incubation times to which the cells were subjected–122 h in BRIC-18 vs. 25 h in BRIC-21–due to the well-documented phenomenon of stationary phase mutagenesis in  B. subtilis  ( Robleto et al., 2007 ).

Spectrum of Rif R \n rpoB  Mutations in FL vs. GC Experiments The N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III of the  rpoB  gene were PCR amplified from  B. subtilis  strain 168 and from the Rif R  mutants obtained from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 FL and GC experiments. Nucleotide sequences were determined from a total of 56 FL and 15 GC samples from BRIC-18 ( Table  4 ) and from a total of 72 FL and 38 GC samples from BRIC-21 ( Table  5 ). Both sets of data are summarized graphically in  Figure  3 . Examination of the data revealed several striking differences in the mutational spectrum within  rpoB  between the FL and GC samples.

Accordingly, statistical comparison of the total CFU obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights uncovered that cells grew to significantly higher titers in the BRIC-21 experiment, to an average total CFU per PDFU of 1.72 × 10 8  (FL) and 2.13 × 10 8  (GC) ( P  < 0.005). As found in the BRIC-18 mission, FL vs. GC titers within the BRIC-21 mission were determined to be not significantly different ( Figure  1 ).

Mutation Frequencies to Rif R  in FL vs. GC Samples The mutation frequency to Rif R  was determined for both FL and GC samples recovered from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments ( Figure  2 ). Because the data were determined not to be normally distributed, they were analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.9 × 10 -6  (FL) and 7.54 × 10 -6  (GC); these values were determined to be not significantly different ( Figure  2 ). In the BRIC-21 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.11 × 10 -8  (FL) and 1.94 × 10 -8  (GC); again, these values were determined to be not significantly different ( Figure  2 ). However, statistical comparison of the mutation frequencies to Rif R  obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights revealed that cells demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of mutation to Rif R  in the BRIC-18 experiment ( P  < 0.007). Again, this may result from differences in the incubation times to which the cells were subjected–122 h in BRIC-18 vs. 25 h in BRIC-21–due to the well-documented phenomenon of stationary phase mutagenesis in  B. subtilis  ( Robleto et al., 2007 ).

  "discussion": "Discussion In this communication we describe the results of two spaceflight experiments using  B. subtilis  in which growth, the frequency of mutation to Rif R , and the corresponding spectrum of mutations within the Rif R  regions of the  rpoB  gene, were measured. Growth in FL vs GC Samples A number of experiments have been conducted in which various bacterial species have been cultivated under otherwise-matching conditions of hardware, media, inoculation, etc., and their growth, as measured by final cell density, has been compared in spaceflight vs. ground control samples. Some of these prior studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have found either no significant differences between spaceflight and 1 ×  g  conditions (reviewed in  Benoit and Klaus, 2007 ;  Horneck et al., 2010 ;  Kim et al., 2013 ;  Rosenzweig et al., 2014 ;  Coil et al., 2016 ), or even decreased growth in spaceflight ( Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ). In both the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments described here, we measured no statistically significant difference in the final viable counts of  Bacillus subtilis  cells in FL vs. GC samples. As in most previous spaceflight experiments, the design of BRIC canisters does not allow growth measurements to be taken during the experiment, thus it was not possible to determine growth rates. However, the growth rate of  B. subtilis  cells in spaceflight vs. matched ground control samples was directly measured in the SESLO (Space Environment Survivability of Living Organisms) payload of the O/OREOS nanosatellite, and in that experiment cells were observed to grow at a slower rate in spaceflight ( Nicholson et al., 2011 ). Mutation Frequencies in FL vs. GC Samples Although the human spaceflight environment in Low Earth Orbit is characterized by an increased flux of high-energy particles, and enhanced space radiation effects have been documented in astronauts and higher organisms (reviewed in  De Micco et al., 2011 ;  Maalouf et al., 2011 ), very few studies to date have tested the notion that exposure to the human spaceflight environment could lead to increased mutagenesis in microbes. In two prior studies, the mutation frequency was either found not to be different in FL vs. GC ( Yatagai et al., 2000 ) or to be elevated ∼24-fold in FL samples ( Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ). The results described here, from 2 separate spaceflight missions to the ISS (BRIC-18 and BRIC-21), showed that the frequency of mutation to Rif R  in  B. subtilis  was not significantly different in FL vs GC samples. Spectrum of  rpoB  Mutations in FL vs. GC The BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments reported here showed that the spectrum of mutations in  B. subtilis rpoB  leading to Rif R  was substantially different in FL vs. GC samples. Especially noteworthy were the mutations at Q137R and L489S which were identified only in FL samples; these alleles have never before been observed in  B. subtilis rpoB.  The results",
