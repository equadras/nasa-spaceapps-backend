While some means of microbial control are in place, including a phosphoric acid/hexavalent chromium urine pretreatment solution, many areas within the WRS are not available for routine microbial monitoring. Due to refurbishment needs, two flex lines from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) within the WRS were removed and returned to Earth. The water from within these lines, as well as flush water, was microbially evaluated. Culture and culture-independent analysis revealed the presence of  Burkholderia ,  Paraburkholderia , and  Leifsonia . Fungal culture also identified  Fusarium  and  Lecythophora . Hybrid  de novo  genome analysis of the five distinct  Burkholderia  isolates identified them as  B. contaminans,  while the two  Paraburkholderia  isolates were identified as  P. fungorum . Chromate-resistance gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the point-of-use potable water dispenser and/or current NCBI references, indicating that unique populations exist within distinct niches in the WRS. Beyond genomic analysis, fixed samples directly from the lines were imaged by environmental scanning electron microscopy, which detailed networks of fungal-bacterial biofilms. This is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. For all bacteria isolated, biofilm potential was further characterized, with the  B. contaminans  isolates demonstrating the most considerable biofilm formation. Moreover, the genomes of the  B. contaminans  revealed secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. The potential production of these gene cluster metabolites was phenotypically evaluated through biofilm, bacterial-fungal interaction, and hemolytic assays. Collectively, these data identify the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche and novel area of biofilm growth within the WRS. Further investigation of these organisms and their resistance profiles will enable engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in future space station water systems.",

  "full_text": "1 Introduction A clean and reliable source of water is critical for human spaceflight. With increases in the duration of crewed mission onboard the International Space Station (ISS), the practice of manifesting water, implemented during the Shuttle Program, has become insufficient to meet water demands. As a result, the U.S. Water Recovery System (WRS) was launched to the ISS in 2008 with the goal of generating potable water from urine distillate, humidity condensate, and Sabatier product water, as well as the occasional off-loading of ground-supplied water [ 1 ]. The WRS consists of the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) and the Water Processor Assembly (WPA). As the UPA processes urine, some batches may sit stagnant for hours to days before moving through the system. Therefore, a pretreatment solution containing phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ), and hexavalent chromium (Cr 6+ ), an oxidizing agent, is added to the urine as a stabilizer. This pretreatment solution serves in both microbial control and chemical stability [ 2 ]. Upon reacting with the organics in the urine, Cr 6+  is reduced to Cr 3+  and due to the phosphoric acid, the overall pH of the treated urine falls to less than two. Treated urine then enters the Distillation Assembly (DA) of the UPA ( Fig. 1 ). Following processing by the DA, two byproducts remain, distillate and urine brine. The urine distillate undergoes additional processing by the WPA before being considered potable, while the brine is left behind. This brine solution contains approximately 13% of the starting water in the urine as well as low-boiling point organics and inorganics. The DA functions under a vacuum to reduce the heat required to reach boiling point. Following distillation, UPA flex line 115 (UPA115) carries water vapor to the purge pump, where condensation occurs prior to collection for further processing by the WPA [ 4 ] ( Fig. 1 ). The urine brine is transferred from the DA by UPA flex line 95 (UPA95) into the recycling tank ( Fig. 1 ). The recycling tank accumulates brine, and current technology demonstrations onboard the ISS are achieving further water recovery by processing the brine [ 5 ]. Based on the current system, a maximum of 87% of the water from urine is removed and processed for downstream potable needs. Fig. 1 Urine Processor Assembly schematic detailing the positions of the two flex line hoses (UPA95 and UPA115) ( Fig. S3 ). Modified from Carter  et al , 2011 [ 3 ]. Fig. 1 Upon departing the UPA, the condensed water enters the WPA wastewater tank, which does not have a validated means of microbial control. As such, approximately a year after being put into operation, the flow of water from this tank decreased due to an obstructing biofilm [ 1 ]. Biofouling within the ISS water system presents a significant risk to both vehicle and crew health. Biofilms can block lines and restrict access to clean water. Should pathogens be present, the risk of crew infection dramatically increases. Additionally, the persistence of biofilms can result in corrosion, overall materials degradation, and a failed water system. For these reasons, as a remedy to the biofilm noted downstream of the wastewater tank, additional filtration was added. While this water is examined periodically, the microbial profiles are determined after return of samples to Earth. The time in-between sample collection and analysis, and the lack of preservation, results in a skewed representation of the microbial population. The wastewater tank likely contains a thriving microbial community, but low diversity is noted upon ground evaluation, and no insight is gained toward the presence of possible biofilms. It is critical to enhance our understanding toward the microbial profiles, as well as associated biofilm potential, within the existing ISS WRS to the fullest extent to prepare for the next generation of spaceflight water systems. Catalytic oxidation, filtration, and the addition of a biocide during WPA processing serve to substantially reduce microbial contamination in the potable water. This water is held to stringent acceptability limits: 50 colony forming units (CFU)/mL for total bacteria and no detectable coliforms per 100 mL [ 6 ]. The presence of coliforms is assessed monthly, while total bacteria are evaluated every quarter. There has never been a true positive coliform detected, and apart from the early checkout process, the levels of culturable bacteria are well below the requirement. However, following assessments of the wastewater tank, solenoid valve crevices, and filter mesh for the U.S. and Russian water systems, increased microbial levels have been noted [ 7 ]. To survey the unique microbial community that is present in the water from the Potable Water Dispenser (PWD), the crew filters and cultures the bacteria onboard the ISS, then returns them to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Microbiology Laboratory for identification via partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing [ 6 ]. These techniques can determine both the overall bacterial levels (through in-flight colony counting) and the identification of culturable taxa. Typically, the level of bacteria is in the range of a few CFUs per ml. The bacterial genera routinely include common water contaminants such as  Burkholderia ,  Ralstonia ,  Curvibacter ,  Cupriavidus ,  Sphingobium , and, frequently, other Gram-negative organisms that cannot be identified through the laboratory’s standard methods. As mentioned, the present method has important limitations, including the length of time between sample collection on orbit and subsequent analysis and possible degradation during transport from the ISS to the laboratory. Therefore, understanding of the actual microbial profiles within these systems would be enhanced by near real-time monitoring capabilities. Previous work has already demonstrated that sequencing in space is possible and can be performed with identical outcomes to those on the ground [ [8] ,  [9] ,  [10] ]. This shift in paradigm from Earth-based to spaceflight-based analysis has implications for a broad range of other molecular applications onboard the ISS, including water monitoring. Future NASA Programs such as Gateway, a lunar outpost allowing greater access to the lunar surface and a staging point for Mars missions, is expected to have a water recovery and recycling system. However, current planning anticipates Gateway will be unoccupied for up to 11 months per year, resulting in a dormant wetted, water system. A means of microbial control is paramount to this future system. NASA has initiated a robust anti-biofouling program in which many teams are investigating a diverse means of biofilm prevention and mitigation, but the organisms to use in these varied investigations are extremely limited. This coupled with a lack of insight beyond returned PWD and WPA wastewater tank samples, drove pursuing of the opportunity to microbially characterize UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines during refurbishment. The work described here aims to characterize the microorganisms found in the returned UPA flex lines and potentially identify the hosing positions as novel areas of interest for biofilm growth studies in the system. The current WRS employs numerous hosing connections with materials and sizes defined by the initial architecture plan. Determining potential microbial impacts regarding the WRS hosing will enable further engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sample collection and fixation The ISS UPA flex lines assessed included the recycled brine line (UPA 95” flex line 96 M 12561- 099 [UPA95]), which was installed in February 2010, and the purge line (UPA 115” flex line 96 M 12561- 100 [UPA115]) installed in May 2015 ( Fig. 1 ). The polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) flex lines transport water vapor and brine beyond the Distillation Assembly (DA) as part of the overall UPA. For refurbishment, these two flex lines were sealed with quick disconnects in October 2019 and remained onboard the ISS until their return to Earth on SpaceX-21 in January 2021. At Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), stagnant water was collected aseptically from both lines, after which the lines were flushed with 250 mL of sterile water. Visual aggregates were present in the stagnant water from UPA115 ( Fig. S1 ). For both lines, 0.5 mL of liquid from the stagnant collection were immediately fixed for downstream environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) using a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 3% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4, ThermoFisher Scientific,  Waltham, MA , USA). The fixed solutions were covered in aluminum foil and kept at ambient temperature for 30 min. The fixed samples were then stored at 4 °C. These samples, as well as water samples from both flex lines, stagnant and flush, as well as the sterile flush water, were shipped on wet ice to the JSC Microbiology Laboratory for further analysis. 2.2 Chromium analysis Chromium concentrations in the water removed from the flex lines were measured using a modified version of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater 3125 (Metals by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry) with a PerkinElmer Nexion 300D. Prior to analysis, sample and dilution tubes were soaked in 1% nitric acid for 24 h before a distilled water rinse to eliminate potential contaminants in the 15 mL and 50 mL metal-free tubes. With the expected presence of elevated chromium and the knowledge of the concentration expected from fluids associated with the UPA, the samples removed from the UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines were diluted to fall within the calibration range of the instrument and analyzed with control samples to ensure quality. 2.3 Bacterial and fungal isolation and identification Upon arriving at the JSC Microbiology Laboratory, all samples, excluding those for ESEM imaging, were processed and analyzed following the laboratory’s standard operating procedures for bacterial and fungal enumeration and identification. Briefly, the samples were filtered using a Milliflex system with a Reasoner's 2A (R2A) agar cassette and a Sabouraud dextrose with chloramphenicol (SABC) cassette (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) for bacterial and fungal enumeration and isolation, respectively. In addition, serial dilutions of samples were plated on R2A and SABC plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA). All cassettes and plates were incubated for two to five days at 35 °C for bacteria and five to seven days at 30 °C for fungi. Following incubation, colonies were enumerated, and each distinct morphological colony was subcultured onto fresh media. Following growth, DNA was extracted from pure colonies representing each morphology using the PrepMan® Ultra Sample Preparation Reagent (ThermoFisher) following the manufacture’s protocol. The DNA was prepared for sequencing according to the MicroSEQ® 500 16S rDNA PCR Kit or Fast MicroSEQ® D2 Fungal rDNA PCR Kit (ThermoFisher) and associated sequencing kits, MicroSEQ® 500 16S rDNA Sequencing Kit or MicroSEQ® D2 rDNA Fungal Sequencing Kit. The prepared libraries were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, Applied BioSystems® 3500 Genetic Analyzer (ThermoFisher), and the sequencing peaks were analyzed using MicroSEQ® ID microbial identification v3.1 (ThermoFisher). For fungal identifications, the isolates were also confirmed morphologically and microscopically. Sanger sequencing data has been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number PRJEB58840. 2.4 Culture-independent, 16S rRNA nanopore sequencing and analysis To potentially identify non-culturable taxa from samples, established laboratory protocols for culture-independent, targeted nanopore sequencing were used [ 9 ]. Using a syringe, samples were passed through a 0.22 μm mixed cellulose esters (MCE) filter on a 13 mm filter holder (MilliporeSigma). The filter was then removed and placed into PCR tubes containing QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen Cooperation, Middleton, WI, USA) for DNA extraction. Following extraction within the miniPCR™ thermal cycler (miniPCR bio™, Cambridge, MA, USA), DNA purifications, quality assessments, and library preparation followed the established method described in Stahl-Rommel et al. 2021 [ 9 ]. The multiplexed libraries were loaded into the flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK) version R9.4.1 and sequenced for 12 h using MinKNOW version 21.02.2 on MinION Mk1C (ONT). Data analysis was conducted as previously described [ 9 ]. Briefly, basecalling and demultiplexing was completed using GPU-enabled Guppy Basecalling Software 4.3.4 (ONT). Reads of 1350–1650 bp in length were selected using NanoFilt Version 2.6.0 [ 11 ] and mapped to the NCBI Reference Sequence Database using Minimap2 version 2.24-r1122 (-ax map-ont) (Li 2018). SAMtools version 1.14, MAPping Quality (MAPQ) threshold of 1 [ 12 ] and MarginStats (marginStats.py 0.1) [ 13 ] were used for sequencing statistics. Data visualizations were created in R version 4.2.0 using the ggplot package and heatmap [ [14] ,  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] ]. Nanopore sequencing data has been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number PRJEB58840. 2.5 Genomic DNA extraction To acquire genomic DNA for hybrid full genome sequencing analysis, bacterial isolates were subcultured onto fresh R2A plates and incubated at 35 °C for 24–48 h. A 1 μL loop was used to pick a single colony from each isolate for inoculation into 10 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Hardy Diagnostics). The inoculation was incubated at 35 °C with shaking at 150 revolution per minute (rpm) for ∼17 h. To collect a cell pellet, inoculum of 1 mL was centrifuged at 16,000 relative centrifugal force (rcf) for 2 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf Centrifuge, 5810R, Enfield, CT, USA). The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was rinsed with PBS before resuspending with 40 μL of PBS by vortexing. DNA was extracted using the Circulomics Nanobind CBB Big DNA kit (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol optimized for high molecular weight DNA for Gram-negative bacteria. Extracted DNA was checked for quality and quantity using the Qubit TM  dsDNA BR assay kit with a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher), Nanodrop TM  (Nanodrop One, ThermoFisher), and TapeStation Genomic ScreenTape using 4200 TapeStation System reagents (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 2.6 Illumina and nanopore genomic sequencing Short-read Illumina and long-read nanopore sequencing was performed to generate hybrid  de-novo  genomes. For Illumina sequencing, 100–500 ng of extracted genomic DNA was used for library preparation following the Illumina DNA Prep (M) Tagmentation (24 samples) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and Nextera DNA CD 24 Indexes (Illumina) manufacturer’s protocol. Following library purification, the DNA was assessed for quality, quantity, and size (∼500–600 bp) using Qubit  TM  1x dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (ThermoFisher) and D1000 ScreenTape and reagents (Agilent). Samples were normalized to 4 nM, then pooled and diluted to a final concentration of 10 pM using HT1 buffer (Illumina). PhiX control V3 was prepared at 4 nM and diluted to 20 pM using HT1 buffer (Illumina). The 10 pM pooled library and 20 pM PhiX control v3 (Illumina) were denatured using fresh 0.2 N NaOH for 5 min at room temperature. The 1% PhiX control was added to the pooled DNA libraries. Pooled libraries were heated to 98 °C for 2 min for additional denaturation prior to loading into a MiSeq® Reagent v3 cartridge (600 cycles) (Illumina) and starting the run on the Illumina MiSeq. For nanopore sequencing, the genomic DNA was sequenced using the Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004, ONT) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, up to 12 genomic DNA samples at 400 – 1000 ng were fragmented, barcoded, and pooled before being purified using a 1:1 AMPure XP bead reaction (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The library was quantified using Qubit  TM  1X HS Kit (ThermoFisher) then combined with 1 μl of RAP (ONT) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The pooled libraries were loaded into a R9.4.1 flow cell (ONT) within the MinION Mk1C running MinKNOW version 21.02.2 (ONT) and sequenced for 72 h. 2.7 Hybrid genome assemblies, annotation, and analysis Illumina short reads were demultiplexed and fastq files generated using MiSeq Reporter Software version 2.6.2.3 (Illumina). Fastq files were filtered to remove sequencing adaptors, reads less than 50 bases in length, and the PhiX sequencing control using BBduk (BBTools version 38.54) [ 18 ]. BBduk also trimmed both ends of the fastq and selected reads with a quality score of 25 of higher. Nanopore long reads were basecalled and demultiplexed using the high accuracy configuration of Guppy (version 4.3.4) with a minimum quality score of 7 and minimum barcode score of 40. Sequencing adapters were removed from reads using Porechop version 0.2.4 [ 19 ] and the top 80% of reads were subsequently filtered for sequences >2000 bp with Filtlong version 0.2.0 [ 20 ]. Illumina and nanopore Hybrid  de-novo  genomes were assembled using Unicycler version 0.4.8 [ 21 ]. Genome assemblies were checked for quality and completeness using CheckM version 1.0.18 [ 22 ]. The identities of the assemblies were confirmed with average nucleotide identity (ANI) using fastANI version 1.3 against the NCBI complete genome database [ 23 ]. Hybrid  de-novo  genomes were annotated for bacterial chromosomes and plasmids using the command line version of the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) version 6.0 [ 24 ]. PGAP was run using normal parameters with quality control analysis enabled. This version of PGAP included GeneMarkS-2 and GeneMark.hmm-2 for enhanced gene prediction using protein profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). AntiSMASH was used for recognition of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (GC) from the isolates [ 25 ]. A search for plasmids in the isolated genomes was conducted using the PlasmidFinder [ 26 ]. Figures and tables were constructed in R [ 14 ]. Graphs were rendered using the ggplot2 program and dependencies [ 16 ]. 2.8 Pangenome analysis In total, 86  B. contaminans  and 10  P. fungorum  genome assemblies were downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq genome database as references [ 24 , 27 ]. Of the 86  B. contaminans  RefSeq assemblies downloaded, six were duplicates and two lacked complete annotations, resulting in 78 NCBI references used this study. The five  B. contaminans  and two  P. fungorum  isolates identified in this study and annotated with PGAP were transformed into Anvio contig databases to be comparable with the downloaded NCBI genomes during the anvi’o pangenome analysis [ 24 ]. Using anvi’o, (version 7.1) pangenome analysis was run to compare the single copy genes from our isolates to those in the NCBI database using hidden Markov models (HMMs) [ 28 ]. Differences in gene number and gene clusters between the isolates and NCBI genomes were observed. The anvi’o summary files were rendered and imported into R where the groups and bins were searched using dplyr (1.0.9) to filter rows based on presence and absence of matches. 2.9 Environmental scanning electron microscope imaging Approximately 100 μL of fixed sample was loaded onto an Isopore membrane filter (0.8 μm pore size, 13 mm diameter, MilliporeSigma) and gravity filtered to reduce disturbance to any structure present in the sample. The samples were washed twice with 200 μL PBS (ThermoFisher Scientific) then rinsed with 1000 μL of filtered, sterile Milli-Q water. Sample dehydration was performed with serial rinses using freshly prepared ethanol (200 proof, Sigma-Aldrich) in filtered, sterile Milli-Q water. Initial dehydration involved two sequential 30 min rinses with 500 μL of 25% ethanol then 500 μL of 50% ethanol. Th",

The WRS consists of the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) and the Water Processor Assembly (WPA). As the UPA processes urine, some batches may sit stagnant for hours to days before moving through the system. Therefore, a pretreatment solution containing phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ), and hexavalent chromium (Cr 6+ ), an oxidizing agent, is added to the urine as a stabilizer. This pretreatment solution serves in both microbial control and chemical stability [ 2 ]. Upon reacting with the organics in the urine, Cr 6+  is reduced to Cr 3+  and due to the phosphoric acid, the overall pH of the treated urine falls to less than two. Treated urine then enters the Distillation Assembly (DA) of the UPA ( Fig. 1 ). Following processing by the DA, two byproducts remain, distillate and urine brine. The urine distillate undergoes additional processing by the WPA before being considered potable, while the brine is left behind. This brine solution contains approximately 13% of the starting water in the urine as well as low-boiling point organics and inorganics.

  "results": "3 Results and discussions 3.1 Identification of microbial isolates from UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines Three bacteria and one fungus were recovered from UPA95, while six bacteria and two fungi were recovered from UPA115, as detailed in  Table 1 . The three bacteria from UPA95 were all found to be  Burkholderia  species by Sanger sequencing but revealed distinct colony morphologies. Isolate 3.1  Burkholderia  sp. colonies were milky white, isolate 3.2  Burkholderia  sp. colonies were yellow, while isolate 3.3  B. fungorum  colonies were smooth and white in appearance. The fungal isolate F3.1 was identified as a  Fusarium  sp. From UPA115, isolate 4.1 demonstrated rough, white colonies that were identified as  B. fungorum.  Additionally, three different  Burkholderia  morphologies were noted. Isolate 4.2 was white, whereas isolate 4.3 was yellow and isolate 4.5 was wet in appearance. The  Burkholderia  sp. 4.5 wet morphology was not noted from UPA95 and the two  B. fungorum  displayed different morphologies. Isolate 4.4 was a Gram-positive bacterium but could not be identified to the genus level. Isolate 5.2 was determined to be  Leifsonia lichenia . The two fungal isolates from UPA115 were 4.1  Fusarium  sp. and 4.2  Lecythophora mutabilis .

Leifsonia lichenia It is not unexpected that a higher diversity of organisms was recovered from UPA115 as compared to UPA95, as UPA95 experiences a higher concentration and prolonged exposure of the urine pre-treat solution during the recycling of the brine, as noted in  Table 2 . Bacterial isolate identification corresponds with historical data, as  Burkholderia  sp. is one of the most dominant bacterial genera recovered from the PWD and wastewater tank onboard the ISS [ [30] ,  [31] ,  [32] ]. The high prevalence of  Burkholderia  sp. is likely due to their resistance capabilities toward a broad range of metals [ 33 , 34 ] Historically, unidentified Gram-positive organisms and  L. lichenia  have been noted in samples returned from the ISS, but more common is the isolation of unidentified Gram-negative organisms. It is unclear if these bacteria survived the pre-treat solution or are part of the population downstream of the DA. While attempts are made to launch microbially-clean hardware for use onboard the ISS, hardware is not launched sterile. The recovered fungus,  L. mutabilis,  has been isolated by the JSC Microbiology Laboratory from returned wastewater (JSC archive, data not shown) and has also been noted from a filter within the WRS [ 30 , 31 ].  Fusarium  sp. have been documented in the ISS environment, and it has associated with plant disease within the VEGGIE plant payload [ 35 ]. However, to the best of our knowledge,  Fusarium  sp. have not previously been isolated from any returned PWD or wastewater samples from the ISS.

However, our current understanding of the microbial community within the system is limited to the WPA wastewater tank and point-of-use PWD samples. This work represents the first investigation into the unique community that inhabits the UPA. From the UPA115 flex line, a purge line carrying water vapor to the DA, three differing morphologies of  B. contaminans , as well as  P. fungorum ,  L. lichenia , and an unidentified Gram-positive bacterium, were isolated; additionally, the fungi  Fusarium  sp. and  L. mutabilis  were isolated. Less diversity was noted from samples recovered from the UPA95 flex line, where concentrated levels of chromium are encountered, from which two different morphologies of  B. contaminans ,  P. fungorum,  and  Fusarium  sp. were isolated. For the five  B. contaminans  isolates, multiple chromate-resistance and transporter protein gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the PWD. Moreover, the UPA  P. fungorum  isolates contained a gene cluster associated with chromate resistance that was absent in the current NCBI references. The acquisition of these resistance gene clusters by these organisms, as compared to both those from the WPA and terrestrial environments, distinguishes these flex lines as a unique ecological niche. Furthermore, this highlights that the flex lines, as well as other areas within the UPA, are ideal candidate areas to investigate horizontal gene transfer. As a dormant water system is a likely option for future spacecraft, e.g. the Lunar Gateway, where biofouling is a significant concern, biofilm analysis and imaging was performed. ESEM imaging of the water from the flex lines and biofilm potential of the recovered isolates demonstrated that these hoses are novel areas for fungal-bacterial biofilm growth. While NASA has a strong "
