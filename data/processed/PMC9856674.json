  "abstract": "Given the growing interest in human exploration of space, it is crucial to identify the effects of space conditions on biological processes. Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of  Caenorhabditis elegans  to simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, we identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated microgravity- and space-exposed worms. Overall, this work provides insight into the effect of microgravity on biological systems during and after exposure.",

  "full_text": "1. Introduction Significant efforts are being made for the human exploration of space. It is known that space conditions can negatively affect biological processes by causing bone loss, muscle atrophy, and immune system impairment, to name a few examples (reviewed in [ 1 , 2 ]). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these adverse effects is largely unknown. Microgravity is one of the major stress factors causing detrimental health effects on humans (reviewed in [ 3 ]). Simulation of microgravity is a cost-effective way to study the impact of microgravity on biological systems. For this purpose, various platforms including drop towers, parabolic flights and space flights are available. Because of their advantages to enable long term simulations in an effective and economical manner, clinostats are widely preferred to study gravitational response in biological systems, mainly plants, for decades [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]. Clinostats rotate a sample around a horizontal axis, thereby exposing the sample to a rotating gravitational vector. This can reduce and even possibly remove gravitational bias in the development of an organism [ 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ]. C. elegans  is an exceptional model organism for space biology studies [ 14 ] with its completely documented cell lineage, high reproduction rate, short lifespan, and high similarity to the human genome (reviewed in [ 15 ]). The usage of this organism in previous space missions (such as International  C. elegans  Experiment in Space (ICE-First),  C. elegans  RNAi space experiment (CERISE), Shenzhou-8, and Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus Science Insert-01 (CSI-01)) have provided valuable insights into the biological response of  C. elegans  to space conditions [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. However, these studies generally have utilized different strains and liquid cultures instead of commonly used OP50-seeded agar plates to reduce the impact of surface tension [ 25 ]. We previously have shown that the usage of different liquid cultures and strains cause highly distinct intergenerational transcriptomic and phenotypical responses [ 26 ]. Similarly, a recent study reported dramatical intergenerational changes in the physiology of liquid-grown worms [ 27 ]. Thus, complementary to the spaceflight studies, separate investigations can provide insight into the impact of individual space conditions on biological processes. This study investigates the effect of simulated microgravity and the sustained impacts after return to ground conditions on  C. elegans  transcriptome. Through the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and mass spectrometry analyses, we reveal the downregulation of the sphingolipid signaling pathway under simulated microgravity. In addition, we identify a putative microgravity-responsive transcriptomic signature by comparing our results with previous studies. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. C. elegans Strain and Growth Conditions Wild-type N2 strain was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC). The worms were grown at 21 °C. Stocks of  C. elegans  were acclimated to CeHR medium for three weeks prior to microgravity experiments. The ground control animals were maintained in CeHR medium in 20 mL scintillation vials as described [ 26 ]. Approximately 100,000 live worms (P 0  generation) were cleaned by sucrose floatation, their embryos (F 1  generation) were harvested by bleaching and placed in ~40 mL of CeHR culture in sterile VueLife culture bags (“AC” Series 32-C, Saint-Gobain).  Supplementary Videos S1 and S2  show some of the worms in the VueLife culture bags. Culture bags were mounted in the clinostat and rotated at 1 rad/s (~10 RPM) for four days, which is the measured time to reach L4/adulthood [ 28 ]. The “F 2 ” and subsequent generations were approximated by using four-day intervals. Prior to RNA extraction, only live worms are retrieved using the sucrose floatation method. We note that “F2” generation and beyond will not maintain synchronicity, and all will contain a mixture of generations, but recovering only the live animals enriches the RNA pool for the expected (majority) generation as each adult will produce ~30 offspring. The reason for the usage of mixed stage worms were the difficulties experienced (e.g., contamination of the liquid medium) during the synchronizing of the animals. 2.2. RNA Isolation, Illumina Sequencing Wild-type N2 strain was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN, USA). The worms were grown at 21 °C. Stocks of  C. elegans  were acclimated to CeHR medium for three weeks prior to microgravity experiments. Approximately 100,000 live worms (P0 generation) were cleaned by sucrose floatation, their embryos (F1 generation) were harvested by bleaching and placed in ~40 mL of CeHR medium in sterile VueLife culture bags (“AC” Series 32-C, Saint-Gobain, La Défense Cedex, France). Four culture bags were mounted in a lab-built clinostat inside a laminar flow biosafety hood, and one was kept aside as a ground control. The clinostat rotated the culture bags at 1 rad/s (~10 RPM) for four days, which is the measured time to reach L4/adulthood at 21 °C in CeHR medium [ 28 ]. Worms from one bag were immediately harvested to represent simulated microgravity conditions. The remaining three culture bags were processed in four-day intervals to represent the return to ground conditions. We note that F2 generation and beyond will not maintain synchronicity, and all will contain a mixture of generations, but recovering only the live animals enriches the RNA pool for the expected (majority) generation as each adult will produce ~30 offspring in CeHR culture. The experimental scheme is limited to using mixed stage worms because of the technical difficulties associated with manually picking the desired age (swimming) worms from liquid cultures. Live worms were selected for harvesting by sucrose floatation and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol treatment and recovered by alcohol precipitation. Total RNA was further purified by PureLink ™ RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Two micrograms of total RNA were used for library preparations using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument set to the rapid run mode using single-end, 1 × 51 cycle sequencing reads as per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq was performed for each condition with three replicates. 2.3. Gene Expression Analysis Quality control on the RNA-seq data was done with FASTQC (version 0.11.2) [ 29 ]. All the reads were in the “very good” quality range. The DEGs were identified by using two separate approaches. First, the Tuxedo pipeline [ 30 ] were used with default parameters. Second, the DESeq2 software (version 1.16.1) [ 31 ] was utilized after quantifying the expression of transcripts with Salmon (version 0.8.2) [ 32 ]. The reference genome (WBCel235) along with the annotation file were retrieved from Ensembl [ 33 ]. We considered genes as differentially expressed if FDR adjusted  p -values < 0.05, and log2 fold change > 2 unless otherwise stated. The results from the Tuxedo pipeline were used throughout the paper as explained in the results and the results from DESeq2 were reported in the  supplementary data  ( Supplementary Figure S4 ;  Supplementary Table S5 ). We discarded miRNA, piRNA, and rRNA molecules from the analysis. The ncRNA molecules (WS250) and unconfirmed genes were obtained from WormBase [ 34 ]. Dendrogram was generated with Ward’s clustering criterion by using R software (version 3.5.1). 2.4. Functional Analysis of the Genes Gene ontology (GO) enrichment for biological processes and protein domains were assessed with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (v6.8) [ 35 ]. The GO network for the common DEGs between our simulated microgravity experiment and four-day CERISE was created in Cytoscape (version 3.4.0) [ 36 ] by using the BINGO plugin [ 37 ]. Pathway analysis was done using KEGG Mapper ( https://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway1.html  (accessed on 1 January 2019)). Tissue enrichment analysis was performed by using WormBase Gene Set Enrichment Analysis tool [ 38 ], and FDR adj.  p -value  <  0.05 considered significant and top ten tissues were reported. 2.5. Comparison of DEGs to the CERISE Four Days NASA’s GeneLab ( https://genelab.nasa.gov/  (accessed on 1 January 2019)) platform was used to acquire the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number for the previous studies on microgravity related gene expressions in  C. elegans . We identified four such studies with the following GEO accession numbers:  GSE71771  (Expression Data from International  C. elegans  Experiment 1st),  GSE71770  (four-day CERISE),  GSE27338  (eight-day CERISE), and  GSE32949  by UKM (PRJNA146465) from the query made on 30 June 2016 with “ C. elegans ” and “microgravity” terms on GeneLab. We used data from only four-day CERISE as the duration of the study is the same with ours. We analyzed the publicly available microarray datasets with GEO2R ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/  (accessed on 1 January 2019)) for gene expression under microgravity at the ISS versus 1G control in four day CERISE. The genes with logFC > 2 and Benjamini and Hochberg corrected  p -value < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed. STRING database (version 10.5) [ 39 ] was used to determine whether the common DEGs from our simulated microgravity experiment and four-day CERISE show enrichment for protein–protein interactions (PPI). We only considered the interactions only from experiments, gene-fusion, databases, and co-expression and selected “high-confidence (0.7)” results. We excluded the interactions based on text-mining, fusion, neighborhood, and co-occurrence as we were only interested in PPI with higher experimental and/or computational confidence. PPI enrichment showed significance at  p -value < 1.0 × 10 −16  with 58 interacting nodes and 155 edges. The PPI network was visualized with Cytoscape (version 3.4.0) [ 36 ]. Edge width was determined based on the “combined score” for the interactions obtained from the STRING database. We identified the human orthologs of the common DEGs in our experiment and four-day CERISE with OrthoList 2 with default settings [ 40 ]. 2.6. Mass Spectrometry for Ceramides The worms were chopped manually with razor blades on ice-cold glass. Three replicates from mixed stage worms grown in ground control and simulated microgravity conditions were used simultaneously. Each sample was sent to Avanti Polar Lipids Analytical Services as a frozen extract in glass tubes for liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) experiment for detection of Ceramide levels. Each sample was extracted by modified Bligh and Dyer extraction [ 41 ]. The samples were dried and resuspended in 50:50 Chloroform:Methanol and diluted prior to analysis. The resolved sample was used for analyses and stored at −20 °C until assayed. Samples were diluted as needed for analysis with internal standards for Ceramides for quantization by injection on LC/MS/MS. The individual molecular species for each sphingolipid group were measured by reversed phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods which separate the compounds by multiple reaction monitoring  m / z  to fragments and retention time. Quantification was performed by ratio of analyte to internal standard response multiplied by ISTD concentration and  m / z  response correction factor. The results are expressed as ng/rnl. The consistency among the replicates were examined with Pearson correlation. All but one replicates in both the experiments showed high correlation (R 2  > 0.9). The ground control replicate which did not show a strong correlation (around 60%) with the other replicates was excluded from the analysis. The data were analyzed with  t -test (two-tailed), and  p -value < 0.05 was considered significant. Equal variances were confirmed with Levene’s test at α = 0.05 for all the ceramides tested. 2.7. Microgravity Simulation with Clinorotation We used a laboratory-built clinostat with an integrated microscope to observe the motion of small objects including microspheres, yeast cells, and  C. elegans  embryos during clinorotation. The trajectory of a spherical particle in a rotating vessel has been described previously in literature [ 5 , 11 , 42 , 43 ]. Dedolph and Dipert (1971) separated the motion of a spherical particle into two parts: a circular motion under the influence of gravity, the radius of which is inversely proportional to the angular velocity ( ω , rad/s), and a radial motion due to centrifugal forces, the velocity of which is proportional to  ω 2  [ 42 ]. The equation of motion that describes the orbital trajectories is given by: m d 2 q d x 2 + ( 2 i ω m + λ ) d q d t − ω 2 ( m − m w ) q = − i g ( m − m w ) e − i ω t . In the above equation,  λ  is the viscous drag coefficient,  m  is the mass of the object,  m w  is the mass of the displaced water,  t  is time,  g  is the acceleration due to gravity, and  q ( x , y , z , t ) is the rotating reference frame defined as: q ≡ x r o t + i y r o t = z e − i ω t . As a test of the performance of the clinostat we recorded the motion of fluorescent melamine-formaldehyde microspheres (5.6 µm diameter, 1.51 g/cm 3  density; Corpuscular Inc., Cold Harbor, NY, USA) suspended in a 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution ( Supplementary Video S3 ). This solution was injected into an 8 mm diameter, 100-µm deep, coverglass topped chamber mounted on the clinostat microscope. Some of the melamine microspheres adhere to coverglass of the chamber, conveniently providing fiducial markers which we were able to use to compensate for the mechanical noise introduced into the micrographs by the rotation of the clinostat. We measured the terminal velocity of the suspended microspheres to be 3.2 ± 0.2 µm/s (mean ± SEM,  n  = 8).  Figure S6  shows a plot of the measured radius of circular motion of suspended microspheres as a function of inverse angular velocity (black dots), and the calculated radius [ 5 ] using the measured mean terminal velocity (blue line). The shaded area encompasses calculated radii for terminal velocities within one standard deviation of the mean. 3. Results To dissect the biological processes affected under simulated microgravity and sustained after the exposure, we first cultured  C. elegans  in CeHR for three weeks on ground control condition and allowed the worms to acclimate to the liquid culture. Then, we exposed the worms to clinostat-simulated microgravity for four days ( Figure 1 a;  Supplementary Video S1 ) and observed the maintained impacts at four, eight, and twelve days after placing the worms back to ground conditions ( Figure 1 b). RNA-seq was performed for each condition with three replicates ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Because RNA-seq can detect low abundance transcripts and achieve less noise in the data, unlike previous space biology studies on  C. elegans , we preferred RNA-seq over microarray [ 44 ]. We generated a dendrogram for the transcriptomic profile in each condition tested and found significant differences during and after exposure to simulate microgravity compared to the ground control conditions ( Figure 1 c). Thus, this result suggests that exposure to simulated gravity induces highly distinct gene expression patterns which are maintained even after 12 days return to ground conditions (approximately three generations of  C. elegans  in axenic medium [ 28 ]). 3.1. Simulated Microgravity Triggers Differential Expression of Hundreds of Genes To identify the genes with the most distinctive expression levels after the exposure, we determined the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the simulated microgravity-exposed and returned worms against the ground control. The genes with over two-fold log2 expression difference with the FDR-adjusted  p -value ≤ 0.05 were considered as DEGs. Hundreds of genes demonstrated differential expression during exposure to simulated microgravity and up to eight days after return to ground conditions ( Figure 1 d). Twelve days after the return, the gene expression levels started to resemble the ones in the ground control with only 91 upregulated and 13 downregulated genes. The spatial expression of the DEGs is of great importance to identify the potentially affected tissues. Thus, we performed tissue enrichment analysis for the DEGs in simulated microgravity ( Figure 2 a). The downregulated genes were overrepresented in neuronal and epithelial tissues, and intestine while the upregulated genes were enriched in the reproductive system-related tissues. Next, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis for the DEGs in simulated microgravity and return to ground conditions to identify the altered pathways and whether they remained altered after return to ground conditions ( Figure 2 b). Our results suggested an upregulation of dorso–ventral axis formation and downregulation of lysosome during the exposure, and these expression patterns were maintained for four and eight days after the return, respectively. 3.2. Simulated Microgravity-Induced Gene Expression Differences Are Highly Maintained for Eight Days after Return to Ground Conditions We identified the number of simulated microgravity-induced DEGs that preserved their expression patterns after the return to ground control ( Figure 2 c). The majority of the DEGs (approximately 75%) from the exposed animals maintained their expression patterns after the return for four days. The shared number of DEGs decreased drastically at 12 days after the return to ground conditions: 16% for commonly upregulated and <1% downregulated genes with the exposed animals. To elucidate the genes showing altered expression under simulated microgravity and maintaining these expression patterns after return to ground conditions for short (four days) and long-term (12 days), we categorized the DEGs in Venn diagrams ( Figure 2 d,e;  Supplementary Table S2 ). The genes solely upregulated in the simulated microgravity exposed animals did not exhibit enrichment for any gene ontology (GO) term. The genes upregulated during the exposure and four days after the return, however, showed an overrepresentation for reproduction-related processes ( Figure 2 d). Chitin metabolic process-related genes were induced at four days after return to ground conditions, and the expression profiles were conserved for eight days after the return. We found that the downregulated genes were enriched for the biological processes which are affected in space conditions. In particular, genes functioning in body morphology, collagen and cuticulin-based cuticle development, defense response, and locomotion were downregulated under simulated microgravity and up to eight days after return to ground conditions ( Figure 2 e). In simulated microgravity and spaceflight studies, both small movement defects [ 18 ] and no difference in locomotory behavior [ 19 , 45 ] have been noted. The reason behind these discrepancies is unclear, but our results indicated differences in the expression of the locomotion genes in close to weightless environment. Similarly, neuropeptide signaling pathway genes ( flp-22 ,  flp-8 ,  flp-26 ,  nlp-10 ,  nlp-12 ,  nlp-17 ,  nlp-20, nlp-24 ,  nlp-25 ,  nlp-26 ,  nlp-39, nlp-33 ,  nlp-28 ,  nlp-29 ,  nlp-30,  and  flp-24 ) were downregulated during the exposure, and this expression profile was lost after return to ground conditions ( Figure 2 e). These neuropeptide signaling pathway genes also exhibit enrichment for movement variant phenotypes ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) indicating altered locomotion in response to simulated microgravity. During spaceflight, the neuromuscular system and collagen are negatively affected [ 18 ]. In agreement with",

  "discussion": "4. Discussion In this study, we examined the simulated microgravity responsive gene expression patterns and their maintained levels for four, eight, and twelve days after return to ground conditions. Longevity regulating pathways such as insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling were affected under simulated microgravity. We identified the putative microgravity-responsive genes by determining the common microgravity responsive transcriptomic signatures by incorporating our study to a previous one with the same exposure time. Moreover, we revealed that the microgravity-responsive genes are potentially conserved between worms and humans by performing function analysis for the human orthologs of the worm microgravity-responsive genes and identifying some of their potential transcriptional regulators. Sphingolipid signaling pathway plays crucial biological roles such as lifespan regulation, apoptosis, and oxidative-stress response [ 52 , 54 , 65 ]. Our results revealed an overall downregulation of the sphingolipid pathway which is generally related to an increase in longevity [ 54 ]. A recent study identified decreased ASM-1 and ASM-2 levels in the ISS-housed worms indicating a similar downregulation in response to microgravity [ 66 ]. Mutant strains or RNAi knockdown of acid sphingomyelinase ASM-1, ASM-2, and ASM-3 genes increase the lifespan, ASM-3 being the most prominent one [ 53 ]. Overall, both simulated and the ISS-introduced microgravity seem to contribute to a potential increase in longevity through the downregulation of the sphingolipid signaling pathway. Follow-up experiments are needed to delimitate the contribution of sphingolipids on longevity under microgravity. In the Twins Study of NASA, Scott Kelly was sent to the ISS for 340 days while his identical twin Mark Kelly remained on Earth. The results from this investigation showed that Scott Kelly’s telomere length significantly increased (14.5%) during the mission. In addition, the sphingolipid signaling pathway was differentially expressed in Scott Kelly. The telomere length of Mark Kelly, however, remained relatively stable [ 67 ]. Telomere length and lifespan have a strong relationship. That is, longer telomeres are linked to longer lifespan and increased resistance to environmental stress while shorter telomeres are linked to accelerated aging and reduced longevity [ 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 ]. Ceramide functions in the regulation of telomere length [ 55 , 72 ]. Considering our findings on decreased ceramide levels and the observations on increased telomere in the ISS, investigation of the ceramide and telomere length relationship might prove important to uncover the mechanisms affecting longevity in space. Most of the space flight-triggered physiological changes are reverted after return to Earth [ 24 , 67 ]. Similarly, we observed that the majority of the simulated microgravity-induced DEGs (over 84%) are reverted 12 days after return to ground conditions. Our results have revealed that ",
  "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Given the elevated interest in the human exploration of space, it is crucial to determine the detrimental effects of the space conditions on biological systems. We believe that our results will be a valuable reference for the studies on transcriptomic response to microgravity by controlling for the renowned batch effects from space conditions, allowing the worms to acclimate to liquid cultivation before the experiment, presenting the sustained transcriptomic responses after return to ground along with their putative regulators, integrating the results from a previous study conducted at the ISS, and providing the response of different ceramide profiles to simulated microgravity."
