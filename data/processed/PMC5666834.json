The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceflight and ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental stresses influence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, are useful for both screening and developing interventions against spaceflight-induced deficits in bone and vascular function.",

The Spaceflight Environment and Its Impact on Skeletal and Vascular Health Microgravity and radiation are two unique elements of the spaceflight environment that pose challenges to the health of an organism. Microgravity leads to a cephalad fluid shift and profound reductions in mechanical loading of bone and muscle. Spaceflight causes perturbations in calcium homeostasis and site-specific reductions in bone mass (osteopenia), and thus may pose long-term risks for skeletal health and tissue repair [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]. In rodent models of weightlessness such as hindlimb unloading (HU), the onset of osteopenia correlates with reductions in skeletal perfusion, vascular density (rarefication), and vasodilation responses similar to that observed in aging [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. These are serious risks for long-duration, exploration-class missions when astronauts will face the challenges of increased exposure to space radiation and abrupt transitions between different gravitational states upon return to Earth. Beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere, astronauts will be exposed to a complex combination of ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and intermittent solar particle events (SPEs). GCR is comprised of α particles, protons and a small percentage of high-charge and high-energy (HZE) nuclei while SPEs generate highly energetic protons and heavy ions. HZE particles are of particular concern during exploration-class missions [ 8 ] (reviewed in [ 9 ]). HZE easily penetrate spacecraft shielding and biological tissue, deposit very large amounts of energy along linear tracks (high linear energy transfer, high LET) that cause DNA strand breakage, and generate secondary radiations that may have additional detrimental biological effects [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ]. Other responses to ionizing radiation include oxidative stress, damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA, adversely affecting functions of membranes, the extracellular matrix, cell cycle and survival [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]. 2. Oxidative Stress and Its Link to Spaceflight-Induced Tissue Dysfunction 2.1. Oxidative Damage Associated with Spaceflight and Its Analogs 2.1.1. Evidence from Spaceflight Spaceflight and the return to Earth may lead to oxidative damage in blood and various tissues as a result of excessive reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in both humans and animals [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ]. Collectively, a number of studies indicate that various tissues undergo altered redox status during and/or after spaceflight. Urinary excretion of the oxidative damage markers, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured in-flight (88 to 186 days in orbit) and post-flight (up to 14 days) in Mir mission crew [ 19 ]. The isoprostane, 8-iso-PGF2α, is a marker for oxidative damage to membrane lipids and is produced by the peroxidation of arachidonic acid in membrane phospholipids while 8-OHdG is an oxidized derivative of the nucleoside, deoxyguanosine, and is therefore used to assess oxidative damage to DNA. 8-OHdG excretion was unchanged during spaceflight and increased postflight. No changes in 8-OHdG levels were observed in Earth-based individuals that underwent bed rest although isoprostane was increased in the ensuing recovery period. Changes in isoprostane production were attributed to decreased generation of oxygen radicals from the electron transport chain due to reduced caloric intake in-flight, whereas the post-flight increases in the excretion of oxidative damage markers may be partly caused by a combination of increased metabolic activity following flight and the loss of some antioxidant defenses during flight. The downregulation of antioxidant defenses as a potential mechanism for the increased levels of oxidative damage post-flight is supported by the observation that hair follicle samples from International Space Station (ISS) crew members at post-flight display decreased expression of endogenous antioxidant genes, including Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), CuZnSOD, glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4 ) and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( KEAP1 ), the regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( NFE2L2  a.k.a.  NRF2 ), a master transcription factor that regulates hundreds of oxidative defense-related genes [ 24 ]. Consistent with the findings in spaceflight crew members, rodents subjected to spaceflight also exhibit alterations in redox signaling relative to ground controls. In rats, short-duration spaceflight (6 days) increases cardiac gene expression of mitochondrial redox-related enzymes [ 25 ], suggesting a possible stress response and/or change in energy metabolism. Although short duration spaceflight (7 days) does not alter heart mass in rats [ 26 ], differences between flight and ground controls were observed in the vasculature of mice [ 27 , 28 ]. Spaceflight induces similar effects in the liver of both rats and mice, which includes elevated expression levels of antioxidant genes and markers of oxidative damage [ 18 , 29 ]. Male rats flown in STS-63 for eight days showed reduced total glutathione (GSH) content and activities of CuZnSOD ( SOD1 ), catalase, GSH reductase, and GSH sulfur-transferase in liver [ 18 ]. In ocular tissue, astronauts are susceptible to optic disc edema, globe flattening, and choroidal fold formation [ 30 ]. The mechanisms are unknown, although mice flown in STS-135 also showed ocular tissue damage as well as alterations in several critical genes involved in regulating vascular endothelial cell response to oxidative stress and apoptosis [ 31 ]. 2.1.2. Evidence from Ground-Based Models for Spaceflight Ground-based simulations of microgravity and space radiation also demonstrate a link between oxidative stress and tissue impairments. Rodents exposed to proton (50 cGy) or  56 Fe (15 cGy) display increased oxidative damage in the heart and decrements in clinical measures of cardiac function [ 32 ] while γ-radiation exposure ( 137 Cs, 1–2 Gy) increases ROS generation and lipid peroxidation in bone marrow, and decreases cancellous bone volume fraction [ 33 ]. Furthermore, bone marrow from rodents exposed to radiation display increased expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 ( IL6 ), tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP1 ), and the pro-osteoclastogenic signal, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( RANKL ), as well as upregulation of  NRF2  [ 34 , 35 ]. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is a widely accepted rodent model to simulate weightlessness for many different tissues (reviewed in [ 36 , 37 , 38 ]). Marrow cells of the osteoblast lineage from HU mice show elevated ROS within a week of HU [ 39 ]. Marrow and bone show parallel increases in gene expression of the cytosolic fraction of the free radical scavenger, superoxide dismutase ( SOD ), changes that coincide with HU-induced reductions in osteoblast activity and bone loss [ 39 ]. HU also causes adaptation-related changes in cardiovascular function [ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ], and several studies have linked HU-induced vascular responses and oxidative stress [ 45 , 46 , 47 ]. Taken together, observations from both spaceflight and ground-based rodent models that simulate weightlessness show that oxidative stress and damage may occur in response to microgravity and radiation across multiple, if not all, tissues. 3. The Role of Nitric Oxide (NO) and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Signaling in Skeletal and Vascular Disease 3.1. NO and ROS Signaling: Mechanisms and Impact on Tissue Function Excess reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and inflammation are implicated both in age-related diseases, such as osteoporosis and atherosclerosis, and following insults such as radiation exposure [ 15 ]. ROS can directly stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts [ 48 , 49 ], and the bone loss due to aging and estrogen deficiency may be partly attributed to oxidative stress [ 50 , 51 ]. Furthermore, treatment with the potent antioxidant, α-lipoic acid, can prevent inflammation- and acute radiation-induced bone loss [ 33 , 52 ]. Oxidative damage from the production of excess ROS/RNS in skeletal tissues during spaceflight may lead to delayed deficits in bone structural integrity and reduced mechanical strength during recovery and the aging process. Under physiological conditions, ROS and RNS such as nitric oxide (NO) can function as signaling molecules to regulate important processes such as mechanotransduction [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 ] and vascular function [ 60 ]. However, at high levels, ROS are potent inducers of apoptosis in response to a vast array of cellular insults [ 61 , 62 ]. Superoxide (O 2 − ) in particular is cytotoxic and is produced when molecular oxygen reacts with an aqueous electron. O 2 −  can be generated by exposure of cells to ionizing irradiation and as a by-product of metabolism, primarily from mitochondria. O 2 −  is an upstream component of many oxidative pathways and can be rapidly converted into hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) by members of the superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) family of antioxidants [ 63 , 64 ]. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ), and other peroxidases such as peroxiredoxin then convert H 2 O 2  into H 2 O [ 65 ]. H 2 O 2  can react with endogenous Fe 2+  or other transition metals via a fenton mechanism to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH•) [ 66 ] which is one of the most damaging free radical species produced by exposure to ionizing radiation [ 67 ]. Normal vascular function requires both basal and stimulated production of NO in the endothelium by endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ). The  eNOS  enzyme utilizes  l -arginine to produce NO and  l -citrulline. NO then activates soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC ) by binding to it. This leads to increased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) which in turn mediates vascular smooth muscle relaxation [ 68 ]. Genetic ablation studies of  eNOS  in rodents demonstrate the critical role of endothelial NO signaling in vascular health [ 69 ].  eNOS  knockout (KO) mice lack endothelium-derived relaxing factor ( EDRF ) activity in response to endothelium-dependent vasodilators (e.g., acetylcholine) [ 70 , 71 ]. Furthermore, they are hypertensive [ 71 ], display increased vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [ 72 ], and platelet aggregation [ 73 ], as well as a higher predisposition to atherosclerosis [ 74 ], thrombosis [ 75 ], and stroke [ 69 , 76 , 77 ]. The activity of  eNOS  is regulated via complex and concerted processes, including transcriptional control, substrate availability, interactions with other proteins and co-factors and post-translational modification [ 69 ]. Under conditions of oxidative stress, the biological activity of NO may decline in resistance arteries. For example, in the presence of O 2 − , NO rapidly combines to form peroxynitrite.  SOD  neutralizes O 2 −  by converting it to H 2 O 2 , thus preventing its reaction with NO and increasing the half-life and bioavailability of NO [ 64 , 78 ]. The generation of excess ROS is thought to be of one of the primary mechanisms by which ionizing radiation causes tissue damage. Dr. M. Delp [ 79 ] and others propose a model wherein microgravity and radiation promote the generation of ROS in the resistance vasculature of bone that creates an imbalance favoring peroxynitrite over NO production. This lowers the bioavailability of NO, diminishes endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and disrupts the coupling of bone circulation with bone remodeling. While more studies are required to test the validity of this model, results from our group and others, as described in the succeeding sections, appear to be consistent with such a model. 3.2. Bone and Vascular Function during Development Are Intimately Associated Vasculature is critical for normal skeletal development, postnatal growth, remodeling, and fracture repair. The embryonic skeleton undergoes endochondral ossification (reviewed in [ 80 , 81 ]) where cartilage, an avascular tissue, is gradually converted into bone, one of the most vascularized tissues in vertebrates [ 80 ]. This process occurs through a series of complex and coordinated signals that induce terminal differentiation of chondrocytes and their subsequent death. The extracellular matrix produced by the chondrocytes is then mineralized and partly degraded by chondroclasts and preosteoclasts, thus promoting the invasion of blood vessels. Following vascular invasion, osteogenic progenitors are recruited to the site, where they form mineralized bone [ 81 ]. A similar mechanism occurs during postnatal growth of the long bones, fracture repair and bone remodeling, although smaller in scale than what occurs during development. There is evidence that re-vascularization in response to bone injury is impaired in spaceflight. Rats that underwent osteotomy and then exposed to microgravity display reduced angiogenesis at the site of injury [ 82 ]. Since proper repair of skeletal tissue requires competent vascular invasion, this raises concerns of a higher risk for impaired fracture healing in individuals as a consequence of spaceflight. The coupling of vascular perfusion and skeletal function has been demonstrated in a number of studies [ 83 , 84 , 85 ]. In addition, administration of anti-osteoporotic bisphosphonates improved blood flow and angiogenesis in aged rodents [ 86 ] while endochondral bone formation and angiogenesis are impaired in mice lacking certain isoforms of the pro-angiogenic signal, vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) [ 87 ]. Increased  VEGF  levels from over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha ( HIFα ) promotes both angiogenesis and osteogenesis, while loss of  HIF1a  in osteoblasts resulted in thinner and less vascularized bones [ 88 ]. 3.3. Vascular-Bone Coupling Occurs via Redox-Dependent Mechanisms: Implications for Tissue Responses to Spaceflight Cardiovascular deconditioning is one of the potential health risks associated with spaceflight [ 89 , 90 ]. A majority of astronauts experience orthostatic intolerance upon return from long-duration flight (129–190 days) [ 89 , 91 , 92 , 93 ] which is attributed to impairments in raising peripheral resistance [ 79 ]. Muscle vasculature plays an integral role in elevating peripheral resistance and, therefore, has been the subject of a number of studies using spaceflight models. In rodents, both spaceflight and hindlimb unloading impair vasoconstriction of gastrocnemius resistance arteries [ 94 , 95 ]. In addition, resistance arteries of mouse gastrocnemius [ 96 ] and rat soleus [ 97 ] both display defects in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In rats, the soleus resistance arteries exhibit diminished expression levels of  eNOS  and  SOD1 , although the gastrocnemius resistance arteries do not show such alterations [ 97 , 98 ]. The basis for the site-specific differences in redox status of vascular resistance arteries is not fully understood. However, there is speculation that this is partly due to region-specific differences in perfusion and/or differences in metabolic rates of slow versus fast twitch muscle fibers and the relative abundance of these fiber types in the two muscle sites. Similar to the observations in muscle resistance arteries, the vasculature of bone also exhibits functional impairments under spaceflight conditions. Two weeks of HU in rats results in deficits in vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) [ 99 ], the primary route for blood circulation to the femur. HU animals display decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance. These changes are not attributed to enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries, but are associated with decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vascular remodeling that reduces PNA maximal diameter. The skeleton, like muscle, undergoes deconditioning during spaceflight (and its analogs) which manifests as a reduction in bone mass due to a transient net increase in resorption [ 100 , 101 , 102 ] as well as diminished mechanical strength [ 4 ]. These coincide with functional impairments and changes in redox status in associated vasculature [ 93 ]. Greater decrements in percent cancellous bone volume were observed after 13 to 16 days of HU and exposure to simulated space radiation when treatments were combined, compared to untreated controls. HU reduced trabecular thickness, whereas irradiation reduced trabecular number but not thickness, accounting for the sometimes greater deficit in percent cancellous bone volume when HU and radiation are combined. In the gastrocnemius feed artery, which served as a surrogate artery for the PNA, the early effects of HU and IR ( 56 Fe) are to each impair peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation, with the combination of HU and IR exacerbating this deficit. These group differences are abolished in the presence of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) inhibitors, indicating that the impairment induced by HU and IR was mediated through the  NOS  signaling pathway. Vasodilation response to the NO donor DEA-NONOate is also impaired by HU and IR, indicating that the depressed endothelium-dependent vasodilation could be mediated in part through a reduced smooth muscle responsiveness to NO. Further, peak vasodilation correlates positively with percent cancellous bone volume which suggests a coupling of bone and vasculature responses to stressors associated with spaceflight. In contrast to vasodilator responses, HU and IR as single treatments or combined have little effect on vasoconstrictor properties or pressure-diameter responses. HU and HU with IR results in decreased levels of  eNOS  protein, while IR and HU with IR leads to diminished superoxide dismutase-1 ( SOD1 ) and higher xanthine oxidase ( XO ) protein content. Decrements in the bioavailability of NO via reduction in  eNOS  protein levels, lower anti-oxidant capacity ( SOD1 ) and higher pro-oxidant capacity ( XO ) may contribute to the deficits in  NOS  signaling in resistance arteries. When the vascular effects of long-term (6–7 months) recovery from HU, IR ( 56 Fe), and the combination of HU and IR are examined, only IR sustains an impairment in peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation [ 103 ]. The IR-induced deficit in endothelial vasodilator function is abolished by chemical inhibition of  NOS , indicating that the sustained dysfunction is mediated through the  NOS  signaling pathway. Similar to the findings from an early timepoint (two weeks of HU with or without IR) [ 93 ], HU and IR have little effect on vasoconstrictor properties. These findings indicate that although both simulated weightlessness and irradiation produce early effects of impaired vascular endothelial function, only those produced by IR are sustained. IR and HU causes differential effects on loss and thinning of trabeculae, contributing to lower percent cancellous bone volume when the treatments were combined. Both treatments impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation of skeletal muscle resistance arteries via a NO-dependent signaling pathway. The impairment of  NOS  signaling, however, seems to be differentially affected by unloading and irradiation; HU diminishes vascular  eNOS  protein expression whereas IR reduces  SOD  expression and increases pro-oxidant  XO  protein levels. If these findings in skeletal muscle resistance arteries hold for bone vasculature, impairments in endothelium-dependent vasodilation may lead to reductions in skeletal perfusion and perturbations in the coupling of bone cell and vascular endothelium activity. 3.4. Cellular Defenses to Oxidative Damage Are Important for Preserving Skeletal and Vascular Health Most aerobic organisms have multiple defenses against the damaging effects of ROS, which include enzymatic and non-enzy",
