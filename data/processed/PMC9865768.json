  "abstract": "As generalist parasitoid wasps,  Leptopilina heterotoma  are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus  Drosophila . The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the  Drosophila  Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure–function relationships will advance novel drug design.",

  "full_text": "1. Introduction In host–parasite interactions, the parasite must provide offensive pressure while simultaneously keeping the host alive to sustain viable offspring [ 1 , 2 ]. Such conflicting goals have led to the evolution of virulence factors with diverse molecular strategies while maintaining high host specificity. Parasitic Hymenoptera make up more than a million species, are ubiquitous on the planet, and parasitize on a variety of arthropods, mainly insects [ 3 ]. Wasps attacking insect hosts have developed an assortment of behavioral and biochemical strategies for success and remain under constant co-evolutionary pressure with their hosts [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. The  Leptopilina / Drosophila  system is an emerging model for understanding the molecular foundations of anti-wasp responses and wasp virulence strategies [ 8 ]. To suppress host immunity,  Leptopilina  females introduce venom factors into their larval hosts during oviposition [ 4 , 9 , 10 ]. The well-defined innate immune mechanisms in  Drosophila  [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] provide a valuable context to study the effects of these wasp venom factors. Infection by the specialist  L. boulardi  activates the humoral and cellular immune arms controlled by the fly’s conserved Toll-NF-κB signaling pathway. The expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such as  drosomycin  is activated after  L. boulardi  infection [ 14 ]. Toll-NF-κB signaling also controls blood cell division and development [ 15 , 16 ], steps that control encapsulation and death of wasp eggs [ 17 , 18 ]. In contrast, infection by the generalist  L. heterotoma  suppresses both immune pathways [ 9 , 14 ], and almost all larval blood cells are destroyed by factors in the wasp venom [ 19 , 20 ]. In this study, we analyze the theoretical structure of an  L. heterotoma  peptide, called LhKNOT, identified within organelle-like secretions in the  L. heterotoma  venom but not in  L. boulardi  venom [ 21 ]. These immune-suppressive organelles include more than 350 proteins and possess a proteomic profile of eukaryotic microvesicles and a plethora of immunity-related proteins [ 21 , 22 , 23 ]. LhKNOT adopts the “Inhibitor Cysteine Knot” (knottin) motif [ 24 ]. The knottin motif is broadly conserved in a range of taxa, from plants [ 25 , 26 ] to snails [ 27 ]. These small peptides (<60 residues) are functionally diverse. Knottins are used offensively, in spider toxins [ 28 ] and cone snail venom [ 27 ], as well as defensively, e.g., in wound healing activities of cacti [ 26 ], and antimicrobial host defense in plants [ 25 , 26 , 29 ] and invertebrates [ 30 ]. The broad range of knottin activity is attributed to the overall structure of its fold, which relies solely on a conserved motif of six cysteine residues that takes advantage of these cysteines’ unique ability to form disulfide bridges. The knottin motif occurs when cysteine residues are observed in a C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6 pattern (where “-“ represents a number of highly variable residues). Disulfide bridges are then formed in a similarly conserved fashion (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6), resulting in C1-C4 and C2-C5 forming a macrocycle, while C3-C6 occurs within this macrocycle, resulting in a “knotted” topology. As this knotted topology largely hinges on the conservation of the six cysteine residues, the knottin motif allows for significant variation in the overall sequence [ 30 ]. The combination of their small size, high tolerance of sequence variance, and observed structural stability has made knottins a popular scaffold for drug design [ 30 ], potentially even for cancer treatments [ 31 ]. Various lines of experimental evidence demonstrate or suggest antimicrobial capabilities for different knottins [ 25 , 26 , 29 , 30 , 32 , 33 ] or gated ion channel interactions [ 28 , 34 ], although the molecular mechanisms by which these functions are carried out are not well understood. Furthermore, it is not known if these antimicrobial functions share a common mechanism of action. Given its discovery from immune-suppressive particles from fly parasites, our goals were to (a) identify LhKNOT-related sequences from diverse organisms, including  L. heterotoma ,  L. boulardi , and  Ganaspis  parasitoids, that attack  Drosophila  and (b) identify any novel structural motif(s) present in the known or new LhKNOT homologs with the hope that the prediction of such a conserved motif might suggest possible functions for LhKNOT and guide future experimental research. We show that a theoretical model of LhKNOT possesses the hallmarks of the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta sheets, constrained by disulfide bridges. The LhKNOT model contains a CPC clip, capable of interacting with heparin, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) of significant medical value. LhKNOT also has the potential for interacting with other GAGs, such as keratan sulfate (a GAG that is highly sulfated, similar to heparin) and hyaluronic acid (the single GAG representative that does not require sulfation) [ 35 ]. Furthermore, structural homologs of LhKNOT (i.e., bona fide knottin motif proteins) also possess the CPC clip motif that can dock with heparin. Surprisingly, like LhKNOT and these other bona fide knottin proteins, even the  Drosophila  Drosomycin antifungal peptide shares this CPC clip motif in its structure. This motif was also identified in 41 out of 46 additional LhKNOT homologs from  L. heterotoma ,  L. boulardi , and  Ganaspis  spp. wasps successfully on  D. melanogaster . These in silico-based observations suggest that the CPC clip motif, inherent in many knottins, may provide the structural basis for modifying immune or virulence functions. We speculate on a possible antimicrobial or virulence-related function for the wasp LhKNOT. The abundance of the knottin fold and its concurrence with the CPC clip motif in most of the newly identified knottin peptides from three  Drosophila  parasitoids suggests an important yet to be determined role for them in parasitoid physiology and/or in the host–parasite interactions. 2. Results 2.1. The LhKNOT Sequence Shows Similarity to Insect and Plant Antimicrobial Peptides A BLASTp search of the nr and TSA databases using the full-length LhKNOT sequence (60 amino acids) showed a limited number of significant hits, primarily annotated as “antimicrobial peptides”, from plants and insects. A few fungal sequences were also identified. All results displayed less than 60% amino acid identity to LhKNOT. The top match for LhKNOT in the nr database was an antimicrobial peptide from the common beetle,  Callosobruchus maculatus , while the top hit in the TSA database was an antimicrobial peptide from the wheat curl mite  Aceria tosichella . The conservation was most prominent in the region of the only sequence motif associated with LhKNOT, the cysteine knotted ‘antifungal peptide’ signature (pfam11410 domain, E = 2.8 × 10 −3 ). After running PSI-BLAST for detection of remote homologs, additional sequences were revealed. PSI-BLAST showed similar results with common ice plant,  Mesembryanthemum crystallinum ; red mites,  Dinothrombium tinctorium ; parasitoid wasp,  Trichogramma pretiosum ; click beetle,  Ignelater luminosus ; parasitoid wasp,  Trichogramma brassicae ; common pollen beetle,  Brassicogethes aeneus ; ash borer,  Agrilus planipennis ; and sawfly,  Neodiprion lecontei . Using the Hidden Markov Models-driven HMMER webserver as an alternative method of detecting remote homologs, we identified five fungal hits from  Akanthomyces lecanii ,  Cordyceps javanica ,  Cordyceps confragosa ,  Rosellinia necatrix , and  Beauveria bassiana . A search of the PDB for similar sequences retrieved only two significant results, one for a knottin-type antifungal peptide Alo-3 from the insect  Acrocinus longimanus  and the second from the disulfide-constrained wound healing peptide pB1 from  Pereskia bleo . The details of all close and remote homologs identified using the different sequence similarity approaches are summarized in  Supplementary Table S1 . An alignment of LhKNOT to the known structures of typical knottins as well as identified homologs showed the conservation of the six cysteines that form the three disulfide bridges in LhKNOT ( Figure 1 A). On its N-terminus, LhKNOT contains a long, helical segment predicted to function as a signal sequence; internally, it contains three beta-sheets, as expected of the secondary structure of knottin peptides ( Figure 1 B). Additionally, an assessment of sequence similarity of LhKNOT targeted to the available  L. heterotoma  and  L. boulardi  transcripts and from another  Drosophila  parasitoid,  Ganaspis  spp. (see Methods), revealed an abundance of related sequences. For  L. heterotoma  ( Lh14 ), we identified 16 additional  Lh14  knottin proteins ( Supplementary Table S2 ). For  L. boulardi , we identified 22 knottin proteins ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Six LhKNOT homologs were similarly identified from the  Ganaspis hookeri  (G1) and two LhKNOT homologs were found in the protein predictions made from the  G. brasiliensis  (VA) genome ( Supplementary Table S4 ).  Figure 2  shows the conservation of these parasitoid knottin sequences with LhKNOT. Thus, at least the few  Drosophila  parasitoids sampled in this study appear to encode multiple knottin proteins. Additional such knottin peptides may be encoded by these wasps, and systematic proteomic/bioinformatic approaches are needed to obtain a comprehensive list. The functions of these putative knottins in parasite physiology remain unknown. 2.2. The Three-Dimensional Structure of LhKNOT The typical structural fold of a knottin peptide is defined by six cysteines involved in three disulfide bonds to form a cysteine-knotted three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet [ 25 ]. An important characteristic of this fold is the connectivity of the cysteine residues to form the disulfide bridges and the disulfide bridge of cysteines 3 and 6 going through disulfides 1–4 and 2–5 to make a special disulfide through disulfide knot ( Figure 1 A,C). This disulfide, through a disulfide knot feature, distinguishes the knottin fold from other cysteine knot proteins. Other than the conserved cysteines, the rest of the amino acid sequence can be quite variable, and therefore, only a limited number of knottins are identified by sequence similarity approaches for LhKNOT (see the previous section and  Supplementary Table S1 ). Fold recognition algorithms and template-based modeling approaches, on the other hand, retrieved several diverse knottins as suitable candidates for modeling LhKNOT. Among the various LhKNOT models generated, the best model was a multi-template-based model of LhKNOT created using the program HHpred [ 37 ] with structural restraints derived from the top three templates, Alo-3 (PDB: 1Q3J) [ 30 ], omega-agatoxin-IVA (PDB: 1IVA) [ 28 ], and PAFP-S (PDB: 1DKC) [ 25 ]. Knowledge-based energy profiles calculated using ProSA-web [ 38 ] for this selected model showed low energies and a z-score of −4.53, which is comparable to solved structures. Verify3D [ 39 ] assessed this multi-template-based model with a passing score (100.00% of the residues in the model have an averaged 3D-1D score greater than or equal to 0.2). The VoroMQA [ 40 ] score of 0.325 is likely a reflection of the small size of the peptide and the scores of the templates were in the same range ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). This multi-template-based model typifies the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta strands, constrained by disulfide bridges and the expected connectivity of disulfide bridges ( Figure 1 D). KNOTER3D, a tool in the KNOTTIN Database [ 36 ] corroborated that this model has a bona fide knottin fold and confirmed the previously identified disulfide bonding pattern in  Figure 1 D. 2.3. LhKNOT Shows the Presence of a CPC Clip, Capable of Interacting with Heparin and Other GAGs To search for potential LhKNOT functions, structure–function correlations of close structural homologs of LhKNOT were investigated. A knottin protein from the cactus  Pereskia bleo  (PDB: 5XBD) [ 26 ] possesses a heparin-binding motif known as the CPC clip. This structural motif forms a geometrically constrained clip of two cationic and one polar residues that interact with heparin by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds clamping it in position within the positively charged surface of the clip [ 41 ]. A structural superposition of the cactus knottin and LhKNOT showed that the two structures are highly similar, with an overall difference of less than 2Å. Docking analysis of LhKNOT with heparin, using ClusPro’s specific parameters for heparin as a ligand, revealed that for LhKNOT, the polar interactions fitting the CPC clip motif occur in residues R1-S3-R14 ( Figure 3 A). Measured distances (both between alpha-carbons and centers of mass of participating residue side chains) differed from those of the CPC clip by less than 1Å, suggesting the presence of a putative CPC clip in LhKNOT ( Figure 3 B). The surface electrostatics of the modeled LhKNOT also showed the presence of the expected cationic binding pocket formed by the CPC clip [ 41 , 42 ] ( Figure 3 C). To assess the CPC clip’s ability to interact with other GAGs, additional docking analysis was performed with LhKNOT and keratan sulfate (PDB ID: 1KES) and with LhKNOT and hyaluronic acid (PDB ID: 1HYA). In both cases, the positively charged binding surface created by the CPC clip bound to the negatively charged molecules. Ligplots generated by PDBSum confirmed an association of the GAGs with the CPC-forming residues ( Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 ). 2.4. Other Structural Homologs of LhKNOT Also Contain the CPC Clip Motif Presence of the CPC clip in both LhKNOT and its structural homolog from  Pereskia bleo  (pB1) suggested the possibility of a broader conservation of the CPC clip within the knottin family. An analysis of 21 close structural homologs of LhKNOT with experimentally solved PDBs in the KNOTTIN database revealed that, in every case, the peptides possess the CPC clip motif. For most peptides (e.g.,  T. tridentatus ), the motif parameters deviated less than 1Å from the core knottin fold, while for others (e.g., the offensive knottins), the deviation was up to a margin of 3Å ( Supplementary Table S5 ). Similarly, modeled knottin proteins of the identified homologs showed that almost all of them possessed the CPC clip. Sixteen additional sequences from  L. heterotoma , 22 sequences from  L. boulardi , and 8 sequences from  Ganaspis  spp., with no known 3D structures, were modeled and analyzed for the presence of the CPC clip motif. While 13 of the 16 putative  L. heterotoma  knottins and 20 of 22 putative  L. boulardi  knottins revealed a CPC clip motif, all  Ganaspis  sequences contained the CPC clip ( Supplementary Table S5 ). Interestingly, the seven homologs that did not exhibit a CPC clip motif belong to (a) the common pollen beetle sequence ( B. aeneus  ( CAH0563829.1 ), (b) fungal sequence  R. necatrix  (A0A1S8A723), and (c) three  L. heterotoma  knottins 4,5,6 and  L. boulardi  knottins 3 and 20 ( Supplementary Table S5 ). A survey of knottins in the KNOTTIN database, unrelated to LhKNOT, but representative of various taxa (cone snail, horseshoe crab, insect, plant, scorpion, and spider), showed the CPC clip motif. In all cases, the surface electrostatic profile of the CPC clip motif is positively charged, likely, to facilitate interactions with the negatively charged heparin ( Figure 4 ). However, similar to the beetle, fungal, and wasp knottins described above, the CPC clip was not identified in knottins from the plant cyclotide and sponges ( Supplementary Table S5 ). 2.5. In Silico Mutational Analysis of LhKNOT CPC Clip Reveals a Secondary CPC Clip Models of three in silico LhKNOT mutants (R1A, S3A, R14A) were investigated to compare binding interactions of wild type and mutant proteins. In the case of the R14A mutant, heparin was shown to surprisingly associate with a secondary CPC clip involving the R1, S3, R30 residues instead of the R1, S3, R14 motif in the wild type ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). Double or triple mutants (R14A-R1A; R14A-S3A-R1A), however, did not show an interaction with any of the primary or secondary CPC clip motif residues ( Supplementary Figure S4C,D ). The in silico mutants with the R1A mutation (interrupting both the primary and secondary CPC clip motifs), however, did show heparin associating with R29 and R30, as they provide the only remaining cationic surface ( Supplementary Figure S4C,D ). Interestingly, the ligand prefers to associate with the CPC clip motif, both in the case of the primary and secondary clips, over this additional cationic surface when the motif is available, suggesting the specific interaction of the CPC clip may allow a more stable association over a non-specific electrostatic interaction. 2.6. A CPC Clip Is Also Present in the Antimicrobial Peptide Drosomycin Unlike LhKNOT, the structure of Drosomycin contains a different fold with an alpha-helix and a twisted three-stranded beta-sheet, which is stabilized by three disulfide bridges [ 43 ]. This structural motif, termed a “cysteine stabilized αβ-motif”, is also found in other host-defense proteins such as the antibacterial insect defensin A, scorpion toxins, plant thionins, and antifungal plant defensins [ 43 , 44 ]. Given the known antimicrobial function of Drosomycin and its related “cysteine stabilized αβ-motif” [ 43 , 44 ], we examined the possibility of a common basis for antimicrobial activity and shared structure–function relationships with LhKNOT to better understand the potential significance of this motif in LhKNOT in the context of host defense. Despite a slightly different structural fold, Drosomycin overlays within an RMSD of 2.2Å of both LhKNOT and pB1 ( Figure 5 A). When the previous CPC clip analysis was extended to Drosomycin, the results revealed the presence of the CPC clip motif in Drosomycin as well. The CPC clip motif in Drosomycin (R6-S4-K38) falls within a 2Å deviation of the motif parameters ( Figure 5 B,  Supplementary Table S5 ). Additionally, surface electrostatics of Drosomycin confirmed the putative CPC clip’s formation of a cationic binding pocket as also observed for LhKNOT and other knottins ( Figure 5 C,  Supplementary Table S5 ). These results suggest that there may be similarity in the mode of action of Drosomycin and LhKNOT and that the biochemistry embedded in this structural motif may drive antimicrobial function in both peptides. 3. Discussion and Speculation Biochemical functions of proteins are facilitated by their overall structures, which are reportedly 3–10 times more well-conserved than their primary structures [ 45 ]. Consequently, sequence alignments often fall short in investigating the functional potential of proteins such as knottins, where the varied primary structures may obscure shared structure–function relationships. In silico methods facilitate broad analysis of potential structure–function correlations for such interesting folds [ 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ]. Our detailed analysis of the LhKNOT structure and its structural homologs supports the idea that this parasite protein has the hallmarks of a knottin peptide with functions in host defense: (a) the closest matches to LhKNOT are antimicrobial peptides; (b) LhKNOT’s Pfam signature describes it as cysteine knotted “antifungal peptide”; and (c) a CPC clip is present. Analysis of a knottin wound-healing peptide bleogen pB1 from the leafy cactus  Pereskia bleo  initially revealed the presence of a CPC clip, a conserved structural signature of heparin-binding proteins [ 42 ]. It has immunity- and signaling-related functions in wound healing and cancer and is used as an anticoagulant [ 51 ]. GAGs are present on animal cell surfaces and have become an increasingly popular target of studies ranging from clinical to cosmetic [ 52 ]. The CPC clip motif of hep",

Such conflicting goals have led to the evolution of virulence factors with diverse molecular strategies while maintaining high host specificity. Parasitic Hymenoptera make up more than a million species, are ubiquitous on the planet, and parasitize on a variety of arthropods, mainly insects [ 3 ]. Wasps attacking insect hosts have developed an assortment of behavioral and biochemical strategies for success and remain under constant co-evolutionary pressure with their hosts [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. The  Leptopilina / Drosophila  system is an emerging model for understanding the molecular foundations of anti-wasp responses and wasp virulence strategies [ 8 ]. To suppress host immunity,  Leptopilina  females introduce venom factors into their larval hosts during oviposition [ 4 , 9 , 10 ]. The well-defined innate immune mechanisms in  Drosophila  [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] provide a valuable context to study the effects of these wasp venom factors. Infection by the specialist  L. boulardi  activates the humoral and cellular immune arms controlled by the fly’s conserved Toll-NF-κB signaling pathway. The expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such as  drosomycin  is activated after  L. boulardi  infection [ 14 ]. Toll-NF-κB signaling also controls blood cell division and development [ 15 , 16 ], steps that control encapsulation and death of wasp eggs [ 17 , 18 ]. In contrast, infection by the generalist  L. heterotoma  suppresses both immune pathways [ 9 , 14 ], and almost all larval blood cells are destroyed by factors in the wasp venom [ 19 , 20 ]. In this study, we analyze the theoretical structure of an  L. heterotoma  peptide, called LhKNOT, identified within organelle-like secretions in the  L. heterotoma  venom but not in  L. boulardi  venom [ 21 ]. These immune-suppressive organelles include more than 350 proteins and possess a proteomic profile of eukaryotic microvesicles and a plethora of immunity-related proteins [ 21 , 22 , 23 ]. LhKNOT adopts the “Inhibitor Cysteine Knot” (knottin) motif [ 24 ]. The knottin motif is broadly conserved in a range of taxa, from plants [ 25 , 26 ] to snails [ 27 ]. These small peptides (<60 residues) are functionally diverse. Knottins are used offensively, in spider toxins [ 28 ] and cone snail venom [ 27 ], as well as defensively, e.g., in wound healing activities of cacti [ 26 ], and antimicrobial host defense in plants [ 25 , 26 , 29 ] and invertebrates [ 30 ]. The broad range of knottin activity is attributed to the overall structure of its fold, which relies solely on a conserved motif of six cysteine residues that takes advantage of these cysteines’ unique ability to form disulfide bridges. The knottin motif occurs when cysteine residues are observed in a C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6 pattern (where “-“ represents a number of highly variable residues",

Remote homologs were searched using Position-Specific Iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST;  https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ; accessed on 4 April 2022) [ 69 ], and Hidden Markov Models (HMMER;  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer ; accessed on 6 April 2022) [ 70 , 71 ]. BLAST searches were adjusted to word size 2, and scoring matrix BLOSUM45, while default parameters were used for HMMER. To identify knottin homologs in select  Leptopilina  and  Ganaspis  spp. not accessible in the protein databases, targeted searches using translated BLASTs against genomic and transcriptomic datasets were employed. To identify additional  L. heterotoma  knottins, the  L. heterotoma  female abdominal transcriptome GAJC [ 72 ] and the whole-body transcriptomes from Ground GHUQ (GenBank Accession:  GHUP00000000 ;TSA:  Leptopilina heterotoma  strain  Lh14 , transcriptome shotgun) and Space GHUP (GenBank Accession:  GHUQ00000000 ;TSA:  Leptopilina heterotoma  strain  Lh14 , transcriptome shotgun) were searched using tblastn (e-value threshold set to 1, BLOSUM62, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) against LhKNOT. The following transcriptomes were similarly searched to identify  L. boulardi  knottins:  L. boulardi  female abdominal transcriptome GAJA [ 72 ] and the whole-body transcriptomes from Ground GITC (GenBank Accession:  GITC00000000 ; TSA:  Leptopilina boulardi  strain  Lb17 , transcriptome shotgun), Space GISX (GenBank Accession:  GISX00000000 ; TSA:  Leptopilina boulardi  strain  Lb17 , transcriptome shotgun), and  GGGI00000000  (female abdomen/head) [ 73 ]. In addition, targeted searches for  Ganaspis  spp. homologs were carried out. For  G. hookeri , the  GAIW00000000  TSA:  Ganaspis  spp. G1 dataset [ 74 ] was searched (tblastn, e-value threshold set to 1, BLOSUM45, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) using the LhKNOT query.

For  L. heterotoma  ( Lh14 ), we identified 16 additional  Lh14  knottin proteins ( Supplementary Table S2 ). For  L. boulardi , we identified 22 knottin proteins ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Six LhKNOT homologs were similarly identified from the  Ganaspis hookeri  (G1) and two LhKNOT homologs were found in the protein predictions made from the  G. brasiliensis  (VA) genome ( Supplementary Table S4 ).  Figure 2  shows the conservation of these parasitoid knottin sequences with LhKNOT. Thus, at least the few  Drosophila  parasitoids sampled in this study appear to encode multiple knottin proteins.

Discussion and Speculation Biochemical functions of proteins are facilitated by their overall structures, which are reportedly 3–10 times more well-conserved than their primary structures [ 45 ]. Consequently, sequence alignments often fall short in investigating the functional potential of proteins such as knottins, where the varied primary structures may obscure shared structure–function relationships. In silico methods facilitate broad analysis of potential structure–function correlations for such interesting folds [ 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ]. Our detailed analysis of the LhKNOT structure and its structural homologs supports the idea that this parasite protein has the hallmarks of a knottin peptide with functions in host defense: (a) the closest matches to LhKNOT are antimicrobial peptides; (b) LhKNOT’s Pfam signature describes it as cysteine knotted “antifungal peptide”; and (c) a CPC clip is present. Analysis of a knottin wound-healing peptide bleogen pB1 from the leafy cactus  Pereskia bleo  initially revealed the presence of a CPC clip, a conserved structural signature of heparin-binding proteins [ 42 ]. It has immunity- and signaling-related functions in wound healing and cancer and is used as an anticoagulant [ 51 ]. GAGs are present on animal cell surfaces and have become an increasingly popular target of studies ranging from clinical to cosmetic [ 52 ]. The CPC clip motif of heparin-binding proteins is considered to be the minimum required motif for heparin-binding affinity and is defined by specific spatial relationships between three residues, two cationic (Arg/Lys) and one polar (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, Tyr). This CPC clip motif is defined by distances between both the α carbons of the involved residues as well as the distances between the centers of mass of the involved residues. Heparin-binding proteins are known to interact promiscuously with other negatively charged substrates, most notably the surface membranes of microbes [ 41 ]. As a result, heparin-binding proteins can exhibit antimicrobial activity to varying degrees [ 53 ]. While the precise mechanisms of this antimicrobial potential are not well defined, it has been hypothesized that the CPC clip may facilitate these protein–microbe interactions [ 41 ]. New potential roles of heparin binding are emerging, such as in the potential therapeutic interventions for amyloidogenesis [ 54 ], so understanding the structural determinants of the CPC clip in diverse proteins may be key to delineating the mechanism of the interaction and its disruption. A clue to a possible antimicrobial mechanism for LhKNOT comes from our finding that its inhibitory cysteine knot and those of other knottins examined here have a CPC clip intrinsic to their folds ( Supplementary Table S5 ). It has been noted that the structural and biophysical requirements for heparin-binding proteins’ ability to interact with heparin are strikingly similar to the structural features of many known AMPs [ 53 ]. Thus, the C",
