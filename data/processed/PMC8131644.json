  "abstract": "Reduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are associated with cartilage degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb unloading (HLU) represent unique opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated arthritic changes in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full weight-bearing. Cartilage and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing readaptation with/without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU occurred at similar spatial locations, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated catabolic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses in menisci. After the 13-day Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed. During readaptation, recovery of cartilage volume and thickness occurred with exercise. Reduced weight-bearing from either spaceflight or HLU induced an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and menisci, and exercise promoted recovery.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) can lead to pain and disability resulting in decreased health-related quality of life, with associated loss of productivity and high treatment-related costs 1 , 2 . The reasons for knee OA are thought to be a complex interaction between patient risk factors (age, sex, race, genetic factors, obesity, diet, exercise) and abnormal mechanical loading of the joint (posttraumatic or malalignment) 3 . In particular, articular cartilage and menisci are sensitive to different loading conditions, and the meniscal degradation and loss of function that occurs in relation to risk factors may result in cartilage degradation and subsequent OA 4 , 5 . While excessive loading from patient obesity 3  or repetitive loading from high impact activities can contribute to OA development 6 , 7 , reduced weight-bearing both prescribed and due to a sedentary lifestyle without physical activity have also been associated with cartilage degradation 8 – 15 .\n Reduced weight-bearing studies have demonstrated deterioration of articular cartilage occurs similarly to excessive loading, resulting in cartilage degradation 5 , 6 , 10 , 13 – 15 . Cartilage degradation, thinning, and loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGS), which impart compressive properties to cartilage, have been measured in humans after post-surgical limb immobilization and spinal cord injury simulations 10 , 11 , 15 . Even partial loading leads to substantial cartilage loss, with 6–8% of cartilage thinning occurring after less than 2 months 10 , 11 . Reduced weight-bearing in rodent models of hind limb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension, or spinal cord injury, likewise results in cartilage degradation 16 – 19 . Short-term periods of HLU (13 days) in rats increases pro-arthritic biomarkers in knee cartilage, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and loss of GAG content 19 . These responses are similar to elevated MMP-3 expression and lower GAG content in rat knees after 21 days of limb immobilization 20 . Longer periods of HLU (30 days) in female mice results in articular cartilage loss at the weight-bearing tibial-femoral cartilage contact point, increases MMP-13 concentration with associated decrease in collagen concentration 16 , and alters signaling pathways associated with joint degradation in femoral head articular cartilage 16 . Short-term exposure of chondrocytes to low weight-bearing conditions alters matrix metabolism, however collagen II and proteoglycan production is increased while collagen X is lowered, which could be considered a favorable metabolic response 21 . In general, short and long term periods of reduced weight-bearing alter chondrocyte metabolism and cartilage health, and is disadvantageous to joint health. Rodents exposed to microgravity in spaceflight experience reduced weight-bearing across joints without the full knee joint immobilization typical of preclinical studies 22 , representing a unique model to study joint tissue responses to unloading. Rapid bone loss and muscle wasting in both rodents and astronauts are well-documented consequences of the skeletal disuse that occurs during periods of microgravity 23 , 24 . Limited data exist regarding rodent joint responses to spaceflight. Of note, sulfated GAG reduction measured histologically from mouse knee articular cartilage was reported after 30 days in orbit aboard the satellite Bion 25 . Additionally, very few studies have examined the response of menisci to reduced loading in general. The meniscal response to reduced weight-bearing is unclear; preclinical studies identify both degenerative 8 , 26  and protective 27 , 28  effects of immobilization, but molecular mechanisms for either response are unknown. Further evaluation of microgravity on meniscus cells is necessary to understand the joint degradation that may occur during spaceflight, and the complex relationship these structures play in maintaining joint homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how actual and simulated spaceflight conditions with reduced weight-bearing affect both the cartilage and the meniscus of the medial knee compartment, the most common site of knee OA 29  that experiences the highest loads across the joint 30 . We hypothesized that reduced-weight bearing would lead to degradation of these structures and a generalized arthritic response. Cartilage and meniscal degradation were measured in male mice after ~ 35 days in orbit aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Rodent Research 9 (RR9) mission 31 . As a comparative study for the ISS investigation, we examined gross phenotypic and histologic changes in cartilage and menisci from age-matched male mice that were exposed to 30 days of reduced weight-bearing via HLU, followed by a 49 day readaptation (return to weight-bearing) portion that examined if running or climbing exercises could recover any cartilage and meniscal degradation that occurred from 30 days of HLU. The ability of articular cartilage to recover upon a return to normal ambulation and weight-bearing is unclear, with conflicting reports 18 , 19 . Finally, meniscal responses in female mice were examined in a short-term mission of 13 days in orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) 32 . The findings of the current study will provide a characterization and quantification of the anatomic and molecular response of multiple knee soft tissues to reduced weight-bearing conditions, including microgravity. In combination with previous preclinical studies, these data further will elucidate how reduced weight-bearing serves as a hazard for whole knee joint health. Results Thinning and volumetric decline of articular cartilage after spaceflight aboard ISS (RR9) Morphometric analyses of the cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau and the medial meniscus from the right knees using contrast enhanced microCT reconstructions 16  revealed that cartilage thinning occurred specifically at the weight-bearing tibial-femoral cartilage contact point vs controls after ~ 35 days in orbit in FLIGHT vs. ground controls (GC) and vivarium controls (VIV) (− 25.4% vs GC,  p  = 0.00070; − 24.7% vs VIV,  p  = 0.0011) (Fig.  1 a,b). Thinning was not observed at other regions throughout the tibial plateau. The volume of the articular cartilage was lower after FLIGHT (− 15.4% vs GC,  p  = 0.0033; − 15.8% vs VIV;  p  = 0.0024) (Fig.  1 c). Importantly, no differences were observed in cartilage thickness or volume between the baseline control group or either GC or VIV (Fig.  1 b,c); however thickness (− 21.6%,  p  = 0.0072) and volume (− 15.4%,  p  = 0.0034) in FLIGHT mice was significantly lower than baseline. Figure 1 Decreased articular cartilage thickness at the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point (indicated at approximately the white circle in the coronal view, and center of the white cross in the axial view, and at the end of the arrow from the upper right plot) and volume lining the medial tibial plateau occurred after spaceflight (FLIGHT) vs Ground Control (GC), Vivarium (VIV), and Baseline.

Volumetric decline and reduced sulfated GAG content of the menisci after spaceflight aboard ISS (RR9) Medial meniscal volume (Fig.  2 a) from FLIGHT was lower versus controls (− 9.5% vs GC,  p  < 0.00010; − 5.9% vs VIV,  p  = 0.0095) (Fig.  2 b). Sulfated GAG content was lower after FLIGHT vs GC, though not significant (− 27.7% vs GC,  p  = 0.31; − 22.8% vs VIV,  p  = 0.77) (Fig.  2 c).

Scale bar = 100 µm. Reduced sulfated GAG content in the menisci after spaceflight aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) Similar to the response observed in long-duration flight, sulfated GAG content in the pooled medial and lateral menisci after ~ 13 days of spaceflight as part of STS-135 was significantly lower vs GROUND control in the left knee (− 11.1% vs GC,  p  = 0.042), and marginally lower than GROUND control in the right knee (− 10.5% vs GC,  p  = 0.14) (Fig.  2 d). Notably GAG content decreased even though these mice were growing throughout the 13 day experiment. Reduced matrix components and increased metalloproteinases within cartilage and menisci after spaceflight aboard ISS (RR9) Sulfated GAGs measured histochemically (Fig.  3 a) using safranin-O staining were reduced within the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau (− 65.0% vs GC,  p  = 0.057) and the medial meniscus (− 60.2% vs GC,  p  = 0.023; − 53.8% vs VIV,  p  = 0.11) (Fig.  3 b). The expression of the type II collagen-degrading MMP-13 (Fig.  3 c) was elevated throughout the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau of FLIGHT mice vs controls (+ 298% vs GC;  p  = 0.031, + 184% vs VIV,  p  = 0.067) (Fig.  3 d) Likewise, MMP-13 was elevated in menisci from FLIGHT mice vs GC (712%,  p  = 0.0064). The proteoglycan-degrading ADAMTS5 (Fig.  3 e) expression within the articular cartilage lining the tibial plateau was greater after FLIGHT vs controls (+ 423% vs GC,  p  = 0.070; + 406% vs VIV,  p  = 0.045) (Fig.  3 f). OARSI scores that indicate the severity of OA, measured from histologic sections, were similar between all groups [mean(SD)]: [GC 0.19(0.26SD); VIV 0.39(0.42); and FLIGHT 0.22(0.36)].

Scale bar = 100 µm. Proteomic analysis of menisci after spaceflight characterize arthritic responses (RR9) Mass spectroscopy identified 292 significantly altered proteins out of 2129 total proteins when comparing FLIGHT menisci to either GC or VIV. These 292 significant proteins were imported into an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to detect altered pathways due to spaceflight by comparing between FLIGHT vs GC, FLIGHT vs VIV, and GC vs VIV. Hierarchical clustering of all canonical pathways detected significant responses of signaling pathways in menisci of FLIGHT vs both control sets (Supplemental Fig.  1 ). Of those pathways, 4 of the top cluster and NRF2 mediated oxidative stress were selected for further assessment and further validation via Western blotting, due to shared differences in protein abundance for GC and VIV vs FLIGHT (Table  1  and Fig.  4 a), and known associations with an arthritic molecular phenotype and due to the described histologic and GAG results. These pathways included: mitochondrial dysfunction; altered EIF2 signaling; reduced NRF2 signaling (oxidative stress); lowered eIF4/p70S6K signaling; and lowered mTOR signaling (Fig.  4 a). IPA assigned proteins with a log2 fold change (an equivalent expression log ratio) > 1.5 (+ /-) and had a  p  value < 0.05 were identified to each canonical pathway (Fig.  4 a) as follows: 31 proteins in the EIF2 pathway; 21 proteins in mitochondrial dysfunction pathway; 22 proteins in NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response; 24 proteins in regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling; and 26 proteins in mTOR pathways were significantly different in FLIGHT vs both GC and VIV (Table  1 ).

Figure 4 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identifying altered canonical pathways, and supportive Western blot analyses ( a ) Canonical pathways comparisons of FLIGHT vs GC (top) and FLIGHT vs VIV (bottom) indicate involvement of catabolic response and increased oxidative stress via p70S6K, mitochondrial dysfunction, mTOR signaling and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress; color coding indicates directional change in pathway activity (n = 10/group). ( b ) p70S6 Kinase was reduced vs controls post-FLIGHT (n = 3/group); pAKT (s473) was marginally lower post flight (n = 3/group); Cleaved Caspase-3 was increased post-flight (n = 3/group). * p  < 0.05, ** p  < 0.01. Validation of proteomic assessment identifying arthritic responses via western blotting Western blotting was used to partially validate mass spectroscopy and IPA data (Supplemental Fig.  2 ). P70S6K, a downstream molecule of mTOR and AKT pathway was significantly decreased in FLIGHT group when compared to both GC and VIV (− 74.2% vs GC,  p  = 0.0053; − 69.9% vs VIV,  p  = 0.022) (Fig.  4 b), while pAKT (s473) concentration was marginally lower after FLIGHT (− 61.1% vs GC,  p  = 0.11; − 53.9% vs VIV,  p  = 0.28) (Fig.  4 b), all of which are aligned with alterations in mTOR/AKT signaling pathways. The expression of cleaved caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis was marginally greater after FLIGHT (+ 363% vs GC,  p  = 0.071; + 318% vs VIV,  p  = 0.080) (Fig.  4 b). Thinning and volumetric decline of articular cartilage and medial menisci after 30 days of HLU Cartilage thinning occurred specifically at the weight-bearing tibial-femoral cartilage contact point vs controls after ~ 30 days of HLU vs GROUND (− 28.7%,  p  < 0.00010) (Fig.  5 a,b). Thinning was not observed at other regions throughout the tibial plateau (Fig.  5 a). The volume of the articular cartilage was also lower after HLU (− 17.8%,  p  = 0.017) (Fig.  5 c). The volume of the medial meniscus was marginally lower after HLU (− 7.8%,  p  = 0.074) (Fig.  5 d). Figure 5 Exercise after a 30 day period of HLU results in recovery of cartilage and meniscal thickness and volume (n = 7–10/group). Arrows point to the approximate location of where measures were performed using 3D reconstructions of cartilage overlying the bone ( a ) Cartilage thickness at the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point was lower in HLU compared to GROUND after 30 days, but not at other regions of the tibial plateau. ( b ) Thinning of cartilage at the tibial-femoral cartilage contact point remained in mice that had previously been HLU but returned to full weight-bearing from Days 31–80 but performed No Exercise. However, thickness of cartilage at the tibial-femoral contact point was significantly greater in previously HLU mice with both Climbing and Running from Days 31–80 than HLU-No Exercise. ( c ) Loss of cartilage volume observed throughout the medial tibial plateau was observed after Day 30 of HLU. For the mice that were previously HLU, recovery of cartilage volume was observed in HLU-Climbing and HLU-Running by Day 80. ( d ) Meniscal volume was marginally lower in HLU vs GROUND on DAY 30. Readaptation to full weight bearing from Days 31–80 in all HLU groups (HLU-No exercise, HLU-Climbing, and HLU-Running) resulted in recovery vs HLU on Day 30. * p  < 0.05, ** p  < 0.01, **** p  < 0.0001. Reduced matrix components and increased metalloproteinases within cartilage and menisci after HLU Sulfated GAGs measured histochemically by safranin-O staining (Fig.  6 a) were reduced within both the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau (− 55.4%,  p  = 0.0020) and the medial meniscus (− 71.7%,  p  = 0.0016) from HLU DAY-30 vs GROUND DAY-30. The expression of the type II collagen-degrading MMP-13 staining was elevated throughout the medial tibial plateau of HLU DAY-30 vs GROUND DAY-30 (+ 122%,  p  = 0.0047) and the medial meniscus (+ 85.0%,  p  = 0.065) (Fig.  6 b). The expression of ADAMTS5 did not change after HLU compared to GROUND (Fig.  6 c). OARSI scores were not significantly different between groups [mean(SD)]: [GROUND 0.33(0.43), and HLU 0.50(0.76)]. Figure 6 Sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) abundance was lower and catabolic enzymes elevated within the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau and the medial menisci from mice after HLU. ( a ) Sulfated GAG abundance was lower in both the articular cartilage and menisci after 30 Days of HLU (n = 7–8/group). ( b ) MMP-13 was significantly increased in the articular cartilage after HLU, and was marginally greater in the meniscus (n = 7–8/group). ( c ) ADAMTS5 was similar between both GROUND and HLU on Day 30 (n = 7–8/group). ** p  < 0.01. Recovery of articular cartilage after ground-based HLU is dependent on exercise Cartilage Thickness: As noted, by Day 30, cartilage thickness measured at the tibial-femoral contact point was significantly lower in HLU mice than GROUND controls (− 28.7%,  p  < 0.00010) (Fig.  5 a). In the GROUND mice that subsequently underwent exercise for Days 31–80, exercise did not affect thickness of cartilage at the tibial-femoral cartilage contact point or promote growth (Fig.  5 b). However, in mice that had been previously HLU but were not exercised (HLU-No Exercise), the significant thinning of cartilage remained on Day 80 relative to GROUND mice on Day 30 (− 34.3%%,  p  < 0.00010) (Fig.  5 b), and also vs GROUND-No Exercise mice on Day 80 (− 32.2%;  p  < 0.00010) (Fig.  5 b). Moreover, marginal cartilage thinning remained in the mice that had been previously HLU but performed climbing exercise (HLU-Climbing) relative to GROUND on Day 30 (− 15.1%,  p  = 0.056). In contrast, running exercise 3X weekly significantly recovered cartilage thickness by Day 80 in mice that had previously been HLU (HLU-Running) vs HLU measured on Day 30 (+ 25.8% vs HLU,  p  = 0.0052), and was significantly thicker than the HLU-No Exercise mice on Day 80 (+ 36.6% vs HLU-No Exercise,  p  < 0.00010) (Fig.  5 b). Likewise, cartilage thickness in HLU-Climbing mice on Day 80 was greater than HLU-No Exerci",

  "methods": "Methods Three sets of animal studies were performed: two involving spaceflight, and another with a ground-based, reduced weight-bearing microgravity analogue. The study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. Rodent research-9 (RR9) All experiments were approved by the NASA Ames Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Kennedy Space Center IACUC, and the Loma Linda Medical Center IACUC, and conformed to the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Male C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were sent to the ISS as part of the Rodent Research (RR)-9 mission in August 2017, spending ~ 35 days in microgravity. The RR9 experiment was launched as part of the SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)-12 mission from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) at Cape Canaveral, FL to the ISS. Mice arrived 4 weeks prior to launch at the KSC and were maintained on a 12:12 h dark/light cycle, and housed in vivarium caging (n = 10/cage). Mice were skeletally growing at the outset 58 . Prior to launch, six cages of mice were separated into three different groupings, with 2 cages per group. Mouse sample size per group (n = 20) was determined by NASA prior to the flight, in accordance with housing capacity of the Rodent Habitats aboard the ISS. Individual animal randomization was avoided to prevent complications related to potential altered hierarchical structure within cages; instead groups were determined by finding the mean mass of mouse per cage so that each group consisted of cages that each had similar body masses. Nine-week old male mice were separated into the following groups: 1] mice to be launched to the ISS (FLIGHT; n = 20) that are housed on-orbit within specialized Rodent Habitats that provide food and water to mice during their stay in orbit while filtering the air; 2] ground-based habitat controls (Ground Control, GC; n = 20) placed inside identical Rodent Habitats as FLIGHT, which was placed inside an environmental chamber that can mimic the environmental conditions experienced by the FLIGHT animals over the course of the mission based on recordings over time (e.g., temperature, humidity, and CO 2  partial pressure), as well as have access to the same NASA Type 12 Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bars, or; 3] standard vivarium controls housed within the animal facility in standard rodent housing (Vivarium, VIV; n = 20). The day prior to launch, the FLIGHT groups were loaded into a transporter, with both groups within their respective cage and isolated with a separator in the transporter (to prevent aggression), and then loaded into the Dragon SpaceX Capsule. Mice were then transferred into Rodent Habitats aboard the ISS, n = 10 per habitat. The day after launch, a set of mice from the same cohort sent from Jackson Labs as the FLIGHT, GC, and VIV groups were sacrificed as a basal control, and tissues were harvested (Baseline; n = 20).

( b ) Meniscal volume measurements were lower in FLIGHT compared to controls (n = 10/group). ( c ) GAG content determined via a dimethylmethylene blue assay was not significantly lower in RR9 FLIGHT vs controls (n = 10/group). ( d ) GAG content from menisci harvested from the right and left knees (side identified in each plot) of mice flown on STS-135 were significantly (Left, n = 12–14/group) or marginally (Right, n = 8/group) lower than Ground Control. * p  < 0.05, ** p  < 0.01, **** p  < 0.0001. Scale bar = 100 µm. Reduced sulfated GAG content in the menisci after spaceflight aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) Similar to the response observed in long-duration flight, sulfated GAG content in the pooled medial and lateral menisci after ~ 13 days of spaceflight as part of STS-135 was significantly lower vs GROUND control in the left knee (− 11.1% vs GC,  p  = 0.042), and marginally lower than GROUND control in the right knee (− 10.5% vs GC,  p  = 0.14) (Fig.  2 d). Notably GAG content decreased even though these mice were growing throughout the 13 day experiment. Reduced matrix components and increased metalloproteinases within cartilage and menisci after spaceflight aboard ISS (RR9) Sulfated GAGs measured histochemically (Fig.  3 a) using safranin-O staining were reduced within the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau (− 65.0% vs GC,  p  = 0.057) and the medial meniscus (− 60.2% vs GC,  p  = 0.023; − 53.8% vs VIV,  p  = 0.11) (Fig.  3 b). The expression of the type II collagen-degrading MMP-13 (Fig.  3 c) was eleva",
  "discussion": "Discussion Reduced weight-bearing prescribed as treatment for orthopaedic conditions or as part of a sedentary lifestyle can lead to joint impairment and degradation 8 – 15 . Rodent spaceflight studies examining skeletal responses both on-orbit and using ground-based analogues (e.g., HLU) are good models to characterize the effects on joint health. While the response to spaceflight and reduced weight-bearing on bone and muscle have been well-documented 16 , 33 – 35 , the effects on articular cartilage and menisci during spaceflight are poorly understood despite the relevance for astronaut health and performance, and as an analogue for reduced weight-bearing on the ground 36 , 37 . In this study, both the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau and stabilizing menisci within knees developed arthritic responses to periods of reduced weight-bearing during spaceflight and from HLU on Earth. The most important findings of this study are that: 1] cartilage degradation after both spaceflight for 35 days and HLU for 30 days occurs at the point of greatest tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact during weight-bearing in both conditions. As no differences were seen between Baseline and other controls with regard to thickness or volumetric changes, the differences post-flight represent change vs reduced growth; 2] cartilage and meniscal degradation from HLU in male mice resembles the extent and spatial distribution of degradation that has previously been observed to occur in female mice 16  and male rats 19 ; and, 3] recovery of cartilage volume and thickness is possible with exercise upon a return to joint loading. In the context of these findings, it is important to identify that rodents that are part of the rodent flight studies are active in-flight, and have been shown to locomote primarily with forelimbs and thus experienced highly reduced (but not abolished) weight-bearing across hind limb joints 22 . With regards to astronaut health and performance, maintenance of skeletal health is a critical component of mission success. Normal loads applied across synovial joints maintain health and performance, particularly with regards to the knee 38 , 39 . Thus, reduced weight-bearing experienced during spaceflight represents a potential challenge to synovial joint health 4 , 8 , 10 – 15 , 19 , 37 . The cartilage degradation observed in mice during HLU and spaceflight is consistent with the limited number of existing rodent studies examining cartilage health from simulated spaceflight conditions 16 , 17 , 19  and in agreement with the proteoglycan loss that occurred in rodents during a period of spaceflight aboard Bion 25 . The loss of cartilage volume and thickness in both HLU and FLIGHT knees occurred with elevated matrix metalloproteinase concentration in both the articular cartilage and menisci. Several molecular effectors of OA were observed within the menisci 40 . The molecular arthritic phenotype indicating increased oxidative stress in t",
