Introduction Space is an environment that may have harmful effects on living organisms due to its hostile characteristics such as low oxygen, microgravity, lower pressure, and radiation. Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles. Radiation is of two types: non-ionizing and Ionizing Radiation (IR). The radiation experienced in low Earth orbit is primarily low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) present in the International Space Station (ISS). Organisms in space are exposed to radiation, which affects the health of humans and the anatomy and growth of plants and animals [ 1 ]. Space missions have to deal with IR in current spacecraft and future long-term deep-space missions [ 2 ]. Plants are affected by radiation resulting in damage to cellular components and damage to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) [ 3 ]. Exposure to radiation causes DNA lesions in plant cells such as single-stranded breaks, Double Strand Breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases. This leads to DNA Damage Response (DDR) that includes signal transduction, triggering either DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death [ 4 ].  The plant  Arabidopsis thaliana  ( Arabidopsis ) is a member of the mustard family widely used as a model organism in plant biology for studies of the cellular and molecular biology of flowering plants. It has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks from germination to mature plants. It can be easily cultivated in restricted space, has a small genome, a large number of mutant lines, extensive genetic maps, and genomic resources. Hence, it has been chosen as a model organism for spaceflight studies by research communities [ 5 , 6 ]. Similar to observations made on terrestrial plant stressors, spaceflight missions have made extensive observations and collected transcriptional gene regulatory datasets of  Arabidopsis  [ 7 ]. Plants have evolved genes that participate in DNA repair pathways that help the plant to survive the effects of radiation. Exposure to IR in  Arabidopsis  has shown a decrease in DNA methylation with no effect on morphology or root growth or seed germination [ 8 ]. Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutate (ATM) are  Arabidopsis  homologs of the human ATR and ATM genes, which are activated by DNA single and double-stranded breaks in eukaryotes [ 9 ]. ATM-dependent transcriptional changes in  Arabidopsis  due to IR and its influence on root growth are discussed in [ 10 ]. Two mutants of  Arabidopsis  defective in the ATR and ATM protein kinases have shown hypersensitivity to radiation resulting in the upregulation of hundreds of genes, while both ATR and ATM mutants responded with transcriptional changes to DNA damage due to radiation [ 11 ]. The effect of acute radiation on  Arabidopsis  growth and its impact on protein-coding genes is presented in [ 12 ].  Apart from DDR, plants adopt pigment biosynthesis processes to protect them against Ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These pigments are flavonoids, betalains, and carotenoids. Flavonoids provide a range of color from pale-yellow to blue and belong to the class of phenylpropanoids [ 13 ]. Carotenoids contain up to 15 conjugated double bonds [ 14 ]. It has been shown that light induces expression of carotenoid genes during leaf, flower development, and fruit ripening in  Arabidopsis  [ 15 ]. Carotenoids protect the plant against excessive light and add color to the flowers, fruits, and seeds [ 16 ]. 163 ATR/ATM genes in  Arabidopsis  have been shown experimentally as responding to ionizing radiation in [ 11 ]. We call these ATR/ATM genes radiation-induced genes and other downstream genes of stress signaling non-radiation-induced genes [ 17 ]. There is no putative radiation subnetwork analysis for detecting radiation and non-radiation induced genes that are involved in biological processes related to radiation response in the plant. In this paper, we are analyzing the effects of low LET radiation on  Arabidopsis  found in low Earth orbit experienced by current spaceflight missions STS-129 and SpaceX. As long term spaceflight missions beyond the shielding effects of Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field are contemplated, we also analyze the effects of two different types of IR on  Arabidopsis : gamma photons, which have low rates of linear energy transfer (LET), and relativistic Fe nuclei (here termed HZE), a high LET form of IR [ 18 ]. The regulation of the Carotenoid Biosynthesis Process (CBP) at the transcriptional level is important for the production of plant hormones, photosynthesis, and dispensing of seeds. In this paper, we investigate CBP regulation in the spaceflight environment, as well. As modules are more informative for the regulatory mechanism of a biological process [ 19 ], we perform module-based analysis and have identified radiation and non-radiation induced gene/protein interactions in DNA repair processes, as well as flavonoids and carotenoids that respond to light environment in spaceflight. We call these modules subnetworks. The  hypothesis  of this research is: if subnetworks of radiation-induced biological processes are extracted, then hub genes and target (authority) genes including non-radiation induced genes can be identified, because network analysis detects and ranks hub genes and authority genes. Furthermore, topological and algebraic spectral network analysis enables the comparison of the subnetworks for different doses of radiation, revealing similarities and differences in the regulation of these processes.  2. Materials and Methods Datasets from the GeneLab repository [ 20 ] are mined for studying the effects of low radiation doses in low Earth orbit, and very high doses of high LET and gamma photos found beyond Earth’s atmosphere on  Arabidopsis . All the omics datasets in GeneLab are preprocessed and normalized before being published. The radiation metadata for GLDS-7, 120, 37, 38, and 46 are given in  Supplementary Table S1 . 2.1. GeneLab Datasets GLDS-7: the dataset contains microarray gene expression data from the tissues (roots, leaves, and hypocotyls) of the plant  Arabidopsis Wassilewskija  (WS) and  Columbia  (Col-0) ecotypes grown in spaceflight and ground control [ 21 ]. Ground control experiments were conducted using identical ABRS hardware and an environmental chamber programmed to International Space Station (ISS) environmental conditions. The data contains 20,000 genes with five expression values per component. GLDS-120 dataset contains the transcriptomics data of the  Arabidopsis  WS and Col-0 ecotypes, and the gene  Phytochrome D  ( phyD ) mutant of ecotype Col-0. The different stressors imposed on the plants are light and dark in spaceflight, and light and dark on the ground. Gene expression data are available for pairs of combinations of genotypes and ecotypes [ 22 , 23 ]. The GLDS-7 and GLS-120 datasets were collected under a low dose of radiation, with an average absorbance of 1.25 milliGray (mGY) and an average absorbance of 1.655 mGY for low-LET (SAA), and an average cumulative absorbed dose of 1.86 mGY.  GLDS-37 dataset contains the transcriptomic data of four different ecotypes of  Arabidopsis  in spaceflight microgravity and on the ground: Col-0, LER-2, WS-2, and Cvi-0. The seeds of the mentioned ecotypes are germinated in orbit and grown for eight days [ 24 ]. Ground control data is collected under the same environmental stressors. RNAseq is performed to analyze the transcriptomic changes of the ecotypes. GLDS-38 dataset contains proteomics and transcriptomics data of the  Arabidopsis  seedlings. The seeds were flown in the International Space Station (ISS) and allowed to germinate and grow for three days in microgravity [ 25 ].  Arabidopsis  Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60 mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs, and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). The GLDS 37 dataset was collected under a low radiation dose with a cumulative absorbed dose of 1.06 mGY. The GLDS-38 data was collected under a low radiation dose with a cumulative absorbed dose of 0.38 mGY. The above four datasets correspond to radiation exposure in low Earth orbit spaceflights. GLDS-46 dataset was collected under HZE (1 Giga electron Volt (GeV) Fe 26+  high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and photons (γR) which have low rates of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) on  Arabidopsis  seedlings. Both types of radiation showed DSB damage response. This dataset was collected under a very high dose of 100 Gy at a dose rate of 1.8 Gy/min. A 100 Gy radiation dose in  Arabidopsis  would generate the same number of DSBs as a 4Gy dose in humans. We are interested in this dataset because of foreseen long-term manned missions beyond the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field to the moon and Mars [ 18 ].  2.2. Gene Regulatory Network Inferencing Using Pearson Correlation We define a graph-based representation for the gene expressions. Formally, a graph is a pair of sets G:= (V,E) where |V| is the set of vertices (molecules, genes, proteins, nodes, points) and |E| is the set of edges, which is an ordered pair of V. The graph (V, E, o, t) is called directed, if directed edges are allowed, i.e., not all edges have reverse edges as members of E. In a directed graph G = (V,E,o,t), the edges e = (u,v), the origin of e is denoted by o and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two variables (genes, nodes) is defined as the covariance of the two variables (x and y) divided by the product of their standard deviations. Gene expression values ranging from three to eight for each gene are used to compute Pearson correlation. The expression values are linearly related, hence Pearson correlation is used [ 26 ]. We have applied Pearson correlation network analysis to identify key gene players for cell wall biosynthesis, and root growth in  Arabidopsis  in spaceflight using the gene expression values from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 datasets [ 27 ]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used as the measure of correlation (between −1 to 1) and gene pairs are considered co-expressed if their  p -value is less than or equal to the corrected threshold  p -value. The  t -test is used to establish if the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, and, hence there is evidence of an association between the two variables. The genes are treated as nodes and the relation between them is an edge. Therefore, the genes with the highest degree are related to a higher number of target or authority genes. Those genes that have the highest degree or intramodule (within graph) connectivity are treated as hub genes to construct the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Vertices (u,v) are the edges (arcs), respectively [ 28 ]. A graph is weighted if each edge e is assigned a real-valued weight w. In our approach, the weights of the edges between two nodes (genes) are the correlation values. 2.3. Causal Relations Discovery Using Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) Method Causal relations are difficult to infer and require careful application of experimental interventions. However, causal relations can be discovered by statistical analysis of purely observational data, which is known as causal structure learning [ 29 ]. Using Markov properties, a gene is conditionally independent of all other genes except its parents, children, and children’s parent variables (genes). Causal relationships are useful for combining omics data with Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), for inferring relationships between genotype and phenotype [ 30 ].  The method used for causal relation inferencing here is the Markov Blankets (MB) method and Bayesian Network (BN) learning [ 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ]. Joint conditional probabilities are represented by a graph in a Bayesian network, the nodes (genes) are connected by the Markov property which states that a node is conditionally independent of its nondescendants, given its parents. Applying the faithfulness condition, the IAMB of any node (gene) in a BN is the set of parents, children, and spouses (the other parents of their common children) of the gene [ 32 ]. We determine the direct causes of a gene’s upregulation, the effects on a gene or a protein due to the upregulation of the gene, as well as the upregulation of the causes of the activation of the gene. In our case, each gene is a variable with a series of expression values. The Markov blanket of a gene X is the smallest set MB(X) containing all genes carrying information about X that cannot be obtained from any other gene. The MB(X) of a node (gene) X includes its parents, children, and spouses which are the strongly relevant genes to gene X; that is, of genes that support and are associated with the target gene (X). Association measures and conditional independent tests are applied to identify the strongly relevant genes [ 35 , 36 ]. Hence, MB(T) is a causal structure learning algorithm useful for the discovery of regulatory interactions among genes from gene expression data. 2.4. Computation of Network Measures The network measures include spectral gap, girth or diameter, density, connected components, and Jaccard similarity [ 28 , 37 , 38 ]. These are used to compare the subnetworks for each of the processes. Spectral gap: For a graph G, the Laplacian eigenvalues can be ordered as 1 = |λ 1 | ≥ |λ 2 |≥ · · · ≥|λn| (G may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, simple or not). The Spectral gap is defined as: δ λ  = |λ 1 | − |λ 2 |. By normalizing the Laplacian matrix of G, the eigenvalues are λ 1  ≥ λ 2  ≥ · · · ≥ λn > 0, and the Laplacian spectral gap will be: δ λ  = 1 − |λ 2 |. The spectral gap is also known as a random walk, in terms of this concept λ 2  is the most important eigenvalue. Note that if the spectral gap is 0, which means λ 2  = 1 (Γ is not (strongly) connected or if Γ is bipartite), this means a typical random walk will not converge to a unique distribution or dominant eigenvector. As long as the spectral gap is greater than 0, which means |λ 2 | < 1, then the random walk converges to a unique dominant eigenvector, and the spectral gap measures the rate of convergence, the larger the spectral gap (the smaller|λ 2 |), the better the network flow (large h(G), diffusion, mixing, random walk, expansion, sparsity, and other highly desirable properties of the network G).  Girth of a graph is the smallest positive integer  r  such that Trace(A r ) > 0. Let d = d(G) be the smallest integer (if it exists) so that for every pair of vertices (u,v) there is a walk of length at most d from u to v. Then d(G) is called the  diameter  or maximum eccentricity of the graph G.  Density of a graph is the ratio between the number of edges and the number of possible edges. Density is a measure of the compactness of a module (subnetwork) and measures the connectivity strength of pairs of genes in the module [ 19 ].  Connected component in a directed graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the super graph. Jaccard similarity index is used to quantify the neighborhood similarity between two vertices (genes), it is also called topological similarity [ 39 ]. The Jaccard index calculates the proportion of v-type genes between two u-type genes, relative to the total number of v-type genes connected to either u-type genes [ 40 ]. An index of 1 indicates the exact similarity between u and v, while 0 indicates no similarity between the two sets. The above measures are computed for the subnetworks. If the Jaccard similarity is 0.5, it indicates that half of the genes in one subnetwork are also found in the other subnetwork. Furthermore, hub genes of subnetworks are compared using the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measures. Degree distribution is the number of neighbors connected to a node; in other words, it is the number of edges incident on a node. The degree distribution can give information about the structure of a network. The networks can be directed or undirected. In the undirected case, the degree of node  i  is the number of connections it has, and it can be represented as an adjacency matrix, with the sum over all nodes. For directed graphs, there are two types of degree distributions: in-degree, which is the number of connections entering the node, and out-degree, which is the number of outgoing connections. The degree distribution for a directed graph is the fraction of vertices of degree k in  and k out . In this case, the degree distribution is computed for the hub genes in the four low radiation dose subnetworks. Subgraph Centrality of a node is a weighted sum of closed walks of different lengths in the network starting and ending at a node. Centrality measures are used widely in biological networks to infer protein-protein interactions and identify essential proteins [ 41 , 42 , 43 ]. 2.5. Logistic Regression-Based Gene Ranking Logistic regression, also called a logit model, is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there is any number of variables that determine an outcome. The goal of this method is to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between a dichotomous characteristic of interest (dependent variable; response or outcome variable) and the explanatory variable. It is used to model the log-odds of a gene belonging to a specific category as a linear function of the statistical significance. Most likely enriched gene sets will be identified based on the  p -value or based on the odds ratio if a ranking independent of category size is desired [ 44 ]. The logistic regression method is an extension of the χ2-test and has higher statistical power than other methods because the important values do not depend on a threshold. Figure 1  shows the steps involved in the extraction of radiation subnetworks. Pearson correlation and IAMB methods outlined in Section 2B and 2C are applied to the GLDS-7, 120, 37, 38, and 46 expression values of  Arabidopsis  Col-0 ecotype in spaceflight to construct the GRNs. Weak correlations are eliminated by thresholding  p -values which correspond to the largest  t -test statistics in the Pearson correlation GRNs. GSEA is used to extract subnetworks of significant DDR processes with a majority of higher activations of radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes. Radiation-induced ATR/ATM hub genes are identified in the subnetworks. In these subnetworks, genes that have strong correlations with radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes are detected. The genes significantly altered due to other spaceflight parameters that are not correlated with ATR/ATM genes are not detected. Network measurements listed in Section 2D are computed and used to analyze the subnetworks. Certain non-radiation-induced genes that interact with the radiation-induced hub genes are detected in the DDR processes subnetworks. The associated processes and molecular functions of the key non-radiation induced genes that interact with the ATR/ATM radiation-induced hub genes are identified. Flavonoid and carotenoid biosynthesis processes are identified from the Pearson GRNs and MB causal relational networks and their corresponding subnetworks are extracted. The carotenoid and flavonoid hub genes are detected in the subnetworks. The logistic regression method explained in Section 2E takes the network measurements for the radiation-induced hub genes in the subnetworks as input and ranks them from the most to the least significant. The Pearson correlation GRN construction is implemented in Python, and the causal relational analysis using the IAMB method is implemented in R. The computational algorithms for the network measures, and logistic regression ranking of hub genes are implemented in Python.

  "results": "3. Results The gene expression values (three in GLDS-120, three in GLDS-38, five in GLDS -7, six in GLDS-37, and eight in GLDS-46) are used to construct Pearson correlation GRNs. The datasets are analyzed separately. Weak correlations with  p -values greater than 0.0005 are removed. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [ 45 ] of the Pearson correlation GRNs for low radiation dose datasets reveals four main processes with higher activation of the ATR and ATM genes. They are cellular response to stimulus, cellular response to stress, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus, and DNA metabolic processes. The radiation protection pigment biosynthesis processes identified are the flavonoid biosynthesis process and carotene catabolic process. The subnetworks for these processes are extracted from the GRNs for each dataset. The hub genes are detected by thresholding the degree distribution of the subnetworks. A threshold between 5 and 34 for the degree distribution is used to select the hub genes for the Low Radiation Dose (LRD - LRD1 refers to GLDS-37, LRD2 refers to GLDS-38, LRD3 refers to GLDS-7 and LRD4 refers to GLDS-120) subnetworks. A threshold of 19 to 47 is used to select the hub genes for the very high radiation dose subnetworks (HZE and γR radiation GLDS-46 dataset). The protein-protein interactions in the subnetworks are discussed below. The hub genes for each process are given by their  Arabidopsis  Gene Identifier and their gene names inside the parenthesis. The gene names are also listed in the  Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 . The gene ontologies of the ATG genes are obtained from [ 17 , 46 ].  3.1. Cellular Response to Stimulus Cellular response to stimulus process is the mechanism by which a cell detects and responds to external or internal signaling stimuli causing the cell to change in state or activity in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, and gene expression [ 47 ].  Table 1  and  Table 2  show the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measure for the hub genes in the subnetworks for the cellular response to stimulus process in  Arabidopsis  grown in low radiation dose datasets LRD1 and LRD2, and datasets LRD3 and LRD4, respectively. The higher centrality values in LRD4 subnetwork show the greater occurrence of the three genes AT3G27060 (TSO2), AT3G51920 (CML9), and AT1G70940 (PIN3) ( Table 2 ) in the pathways of other genes and play an active role in the cellular response to stimulus process. A higher value of degree distribution for the hub-gene indicates that it is the most influential gene in the biological pathway. The low radiation dose subnetworks for LRD1 and LRD2 datasets have more hub genes for this process ( Table 1 ). The genes AT3G13380 (BRL3), AT3G61630 (CRF6), and AT5G61600 (ERF104) have higher values than other hub genes in the low radiation dose subnetworks. They are brassinosteroid receptor proteins and ethylene-responsive transcription factors involved in protein and DNA-binding molecular functions. 3.2. Cellular Response to Stress Environmental stressors such as extreme temperature, exposure to toxins, radiation, and mechanical damage result in molecular changes that cells undergo in response to these stressors [ 48 ].  Table 3  shows the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measure for the hub genes in the subnetworks for the cellular response to stress process for low radiation dose (datasets LRD1 and LRD2). The AT5G48720 (XRI1) has a higher degree distribution and subgraph centrality measures in the low radiation dose (LRD2) subnetwork ( Table 3 ). While there are four hub genes involved in cellular response to stress in the low radiation dose LRD1 and LRD2 subnetworks, there is only one hub gene in the low radiation dose LRD3 and LRD4 subnetworks ( Table 4 ).  3.3. Cellular Response to DNA Damage Stimulus  DNA damage due to environmental stress such as radiation or errors in metabolism causes the cell to change in state or activity in terms of movement, secreti",
  "discussion": "4. Discussion 4.1. Computational Strategy Radiation data for GLDS studies in the ISS are provided in [ 52 ]. Previous studies of  Arabidopsis  in spaceflight missions have focused on non-radiation stress responses that are due to microgravity, although radiation is an important stressor in spaceflight [ 47 ]. The effect of ionizing radiation has been presented using traditional fold change analysis methods in [ 11 , 18 ]. The novelty of our approach is the performance of computational modular subnetwork analysis of biological processes involving a majority of radiation-induced genes. Our modular analysis approach provides a better insight into the complex gene interaction profiles between radiation-induced and non-radiation-induced genes in DDR processes. We have also determined gene associations using the Bayesian Markov blanket method which identifies key genes based on the relevance of gene associations. This method is attractive because of its ability to describe complex stochastic processes with noisy observations. We have used IAMB innovatively in identifying causal relations between ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes and non-radiation-induced genes. We have innovatively used the Jaccard similarity index to show the similarity of neighborhood interactions of ATR/ATM genes in the subnetworks for DDR processes. This index is not biased by low-level, noise-derived, variability in expression [ 53 ]. We have also shown how topological network measures of degree distribution are useful for the extraction of subnetwork modules from larger GRNs. The subnetworks sampled from the original GRNs also have a scale-free topology with a degree distribution that follows an exponential power law [ 54 ]. Centrality measures are useful for distinguishing protein complexes [ 55 ]. It has been shown that the subgraph centrality has better discriminatory power than other centrality measures such as Eigenvector, closeness, and betweenness centrality [ 56 ]. Subgraph centrality has been used here to distinguish the hub genes involved in the DDR processes. The network measures of diameter, connected components, and density have important biological implications as they can predict gene regulatory interaction landscape intrinsic to the organism [ 57 ]. The density is the lowest for the LRD2 dataset indicating the sparseness of the subnetworks [ 58 ]. The network measures for the subnetworks reveal quantitatively different emerging properties for  Arabidopsis  grown in different radiation dose environments. The number of connected components and diameter of the subnetworks for the DDR processes show large variability for low and very high radiation doses. The spectral gap has large values in the very high radiation dose subnetworks than in low radiation dose subnetworks indicating sparseness and high connectivity of the networks. Many biological systems are modular which results from the sparseness in the GRNs [ 59 ]. The novel algebraic analysis using spectral gap comp",
  "conclusion": "5. Conclusions We have applied advanced network analysis and machine learning approaches to detect key genes involved in DDR and their links with genes involved in spaceflight stress responses in  Arabidopsis . Our analysis shows that the DDR processes are intermixed with the regulation of critical functions necessary for the plant to adapt to the spaceflight environment. There is a significant difference in the regulation of these processes in a low radiation dose environment where ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes interact with many downstream genes, whereas in the very high HZE and γR radiation dose environment, the DDR processes are regulated chiefly by ATR/ATM genes."
