  "abstract": "Summary To understand the physiological changes that occur in response to spaceflight, mice are transported to the International Space Station (ISS) and housed for variable periods of time before euthanasia on-orbit or return to Earth. Sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground samples, making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection. This has important implications for the interpretation of existing datasets and the design of future experiments.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Spaceflight places multiple stresses upon the human body including altered gravity fields and exposure to cosmic radiation, which lead to health risks for spacefaring humans ( Institute of Medicine, 2008 ). Decades of research on astronauts has begun to reveal how humans respond to the spaceflight environment ( Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019 ) but physiological monitoring of astronauts is still limited. Thus, rodent models have been essential for advancing our understanding of how mammals—including humans—respond to spaceflight. This includes the impact of spaceflight on muscle structure ( Shen et al., 2017 ;  Spatz et al., 2017 ;  Tascher et al., 2017 ), liver ( Beheshti et al., 2019 ;  Jonscher et al., 2016 ), and immune functions ( Pecaut et al., 2017 ;  Rettig et al., 2017 ;  Ward et al., 2018 ). Despite success of the rodent model, sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. These are related to hardware limitations, small sample size, and severe restraints on astronaut crew availability. Successful experiments must work within these constraints to produce meaningful insights. In response, the first Rodent Research (RR) mission established new capabilities for conducting reliable long-duration experiments using rodents with on-orbit sample collection. Animals can either be euthanized onboard the ISS or returned to Earth alive. Both approaches introduce confounding factors. The former is experimentally challenging but preserves the sample during exposure to microgravity, whereas the latter exposes the animal to re-entry stresses, and sampling occurs only after a variable lag between landing and euthanasia—essentially sampling re-adaptation to Earth conditions in addition to the response to spaceflight. Inconsistent handling of samples necessitates a clear understanding of how dissection and preservation protocols affect downstream data generation. We previously showed, using transcriptomic, proteomic, and immunohistochemical data from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), Rodent Research-3 (RR-3), and Space Transportation System (STS)-135 missions, that lipotoxic pathways are activated in rodent liver in two different strains of mice that were flown for as long as 42 days in space ( Beheshti et al., 2019 ). Because animals in the RR-1 and RR-3 experiments were euthanized in space, this work suggested that space alone was the most likely cause for similar changes previously observed in liver samples from mice flown during the STS-135 experiments where animals returned alive to Earth ( Jonscher et al., 2016 ). The lipotoxic effect is stronger with duration and may have ramifications for astronauts' health during long missions. This analysis did not include two flight and two ground animals from RR-1, as these animals were dissected immediately after euthanasia on-orbit as opposed to the rest, which were first returned to Earth as intact frozen carcasses for later dissection. Here we now compare RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) datasets generated from livers preserved using these distinct protocols ( Table 1 ). We find large changes in the transcriptome of tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved intact by freezing on-orbit, and dissected after return to Earth. To identify and mediate how the preservation method could have such a large effect on differential gene expression (DGE) results, we performed follow-on experiments to interrogate the role of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods on DGE changes. Our findings have important implications for interpreting existing datasets and the design of future experiments.

Results Preservation Method Is the Primary Driver of Gene Expression Variance in RR-1 Liver Samples To assess gene expression differences in liver samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission ( Cadena et al., 2019 ;  Globus and Galazka, 2015 ;  Ronca et al., 2019 ), RNA was extracted from livers dissected from spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) animals either immediately after euthanasia (immediate preservation, I) or from frozen carcasses after partial thawing (carcass preservation, C) and sequenced following polyA selection ( Figure S1 ). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed preservation method (C versus I) as the primary driver of variance among samples rather than spaceflight (FLT versus GC) ( Figure 1 A). Furthermore, there was an order of magnitude difference in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in FLT versus GC carcass samples than was observed in FLT versus GC immediate samples, and only 4 DEGs overlapped between the two preservation methods ( Figure 1 B). Gene set enrichment analysis of FLT versus GC immediate- ( Figure 2 A) and carcass-derived ( Figure 2 B) samples showed no overlap in enriched gene ontology (GO) terms ( Figure 2 C), showing that any gene expression changes in the liver as a result of spaceflight exposure were confounded by the sample preservation method used.

GO terms in Venn diagram met the threshold of FDR <0.05, NOM p < 0.01. Data are from GLDS-48. Since livers from only 2 FLT and 2 GC animals in the RR-1 NASA Validation mission were preserved via the immediate method, RNA from livers prepared via the immediate method from two additional studies, the RR-1 CASIS mission ( Figure S1 ) ( Cadena et al., 2019 ;  Globus et al., 2015 ;  Ronca et al., 2019 ) and a ground-based preservation and storage study ( Figure S2 ) ( Choi et al., 2016 ;  GeneLab, 2016 ), were also sequenced following polyA selection. Despite multiple different experimental factors in RR-1 NASA, RR-1 CASIS, and the ground-based preservation studies, PCA continued to show preservation method as the primary driver of variance among samples in these datasets ( Figure S3 ). Carcass-Preserved Samples Exhibit Less Uniform Transcript Coverage than Immediate-Preserved Samples To further investigate the observed differences in preservation method, RR-1 NASA FLT and GC liver samples derived from the carcass preservation method were grouped together (C) and FLT and GC liver samples derived from the immediate preservation method were grouped together (I). DGE was evaluated in carcass versus immediate samples. Many more genes were differentially expressed in carcass versus immediate samples (2,934 DEGs) than in either FLT-C versus GC-C (619 DEGs) or in FLT-I versus GC-I (67 DEGs) samples, further supporting preservation method as the primary driver of variance in RR-1 NASA liver samples ( Figure 3 A). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that several of the gene ontologies enriched in carcass samples (when compared with immediate samples) involved RNA regulation and processing ( Figure 3 B). Despite similarly high RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values ( Figure S4 ), carcass samples exhibited significantly less 5′ to 3′ gene body coverage than immediate samples as indicated by their 5′ to 3′ transcript integrity ratios. The 5′ to 3′ transcript integrity ratios were determined by dividing the percent coverage indicated in the 5′-shaded region by that in the 3′-shaded region for each sample ( Figures 3 C and D).

(E) Average expression of polyA removal genes in Carcass (blue) and Immediate (red) groups from RNAseq data. Cnot1, Cnot2, Cnot3, Cnot4, Cnot9, Cnot10, Cnot6, Cnot6l, Cnot7, and Cnot8 are part of the CCR4-NOT complex. Pan2 and Pan3 are part of the PAN2-PAN3 complex. Error bars indicate standard deviation (∗ = adj. p < 0.05, ∗∗ = adj. p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ = adj. p < 0.001, ns = not significant, Wald test). Data are from GLDS-48. Expression of Genes Involved in 5′-Methylguanosine Decapping and PolyA Removal Is Affected by Preservation Condition Given the differences in gene body coverage between carcass and immediate samples, we evaluated the expression of 5′-methylguanosine decapping and polyA removal genes in these groups from the RNAseq data. In mammals, eight genes have decapping activity  in vitro  and/or in cells: Dcp2 (Nudt20), Nudt3, Nudt16, Nudt2, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, Nudt19. In addition, Dxo acts on partially capped mRNAs ( Grudzien-Nogalska and Kiledjian, 2017 ). Two of these genes—Dxo and Nudt2—were significantly more expressed in the carcass samples, whereas another two—Nudt15 and Dcp2 (Nudt20)—were significantly more expressed in immediate samples ( Figure S5 ). Removal of polyA tails from mRNA is catalyzed by two complexes. The first, CCR4-NOT, consists of CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT9, CNOT10, CNOT6, CNOT6L, CNOT7, and CNOT8. The second, PAN2-PAN3, consists of PAN2 and PAN3 ( Siwaszek et al., 2014 ). In the case of the 10 subunit CCR4-NOT complex, we observed 5 genes that were more highly expressed in the immediate group (Cnot1, Cnot2, Cnot9, Cnot6, Cnot6L) and 3 that were more highly expressed in the carcass group (Cnot3, Cnot10, Cnot7) ( Figure 3 E). In the case of the PAN2-PAN3 complex, both Pan2 and Pan3 were more highly expressed in the carcass group ( Figure 3 E). Samples Sequenced Following Ribodepletion Exhibit More Uniform Transcript Coverage than Samples Prepared with PolyA Selection The polyA selection library preparation method, which was initially used to evaluate gene expression differences in RR-1 NASA Validation mission liver samples, requires intact RNA to minimize bias ( Kumar et al., 2017 ;  Petrova et al., 2017 ). Because our data suggest that the carcass samples were more degraded than the immediate samples ( Figures 3 C and 3D), the total RNA isolated from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission carcass liver samples was used to prepare libraries with the ribodepletion method to minimize transcript integrity bias, then re-sequenced. PCA showed a more distinct separation of FLT and GC carcass samples when the samples were prepared via the ribodepletion method ( Figure 4 A) than by polyA selection (FLT-C and GC-C samples in  Figure 1 A). DEGs were identified in FLT versus GC carcass samples prepared with the ribodepletion method and compared with those from polyA-prepared carcass samples. Although hundreds of DEGs in FLT versus GC carcass samples overlap between ribodepleted and polyA-prepared samples, more DEGs were identified in FLT versus GC samples prepared with the ribodepletion method ( Figure 4 B), suggesting this method may be more sensitive. There was no overlap of enriched gene ontology terms in FLT versus GC samples processed by ribodepletion and polyA enrichment ( Figures 4 C and 4D).

(D) Enriched GO terms between the spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) carcass samples prepared with ribodepletion identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (phenotype permutation). The more positive or negative the enrichment scores, the higher the expression in spaceflight or ground control samples, respectively. Dot size indicates number of genes within GO term. Dot color indicates false discovery rate (FDR). GO terms displayed met the thresholds of FDR <0.5, NOM p < 0.01, 1.6 < NES < −1.6. (E) Gene body coverage of ribodepleted (Ribo(−)) and polyA selected (polyA) spaceflight and ground control carcass (C) samples. (F) The percent coverage of the 5′- and 3′-shaded regions in panel E were used to calculate the transcript integrity ratio for each sample (∗∗∗ = p < 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Data are from GLDS-48 and -168. Next, transcript integrity was evaluated in the ribodepletion-prepared FLT and GC carcass samples and compared with polyA-selection-prepared carcass samples. Samples prepared with the polyA selection method exhibited less coverage of the 5′ portion of transcripts compared with ribodepletion-prepared samples ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Thus, ribodepletion was used to further investigate the effects of preservation method (Carcass versus Immediate) on gene-expression in a ground-based tissue preservation study. Total RNA Sequencing Mitigates the Impact of Preservation Method on Gene Expression Changes in the Liver We designed a ground-based tissue preservation study to determine the best approach to mitigate the impact of preservation method on gene expression and to identify other confounding variables important for interpreting data from other RR missions. We tested euthanasia and preservation techniques used in different RR missions and compared them with standard laboratory protocols for tissue preservation. In addition to liver samples, we also analyzed quadriceps to determine whether sample preservation methods also confounded DGE analysis in this tissue. Mice of the same age, sex, strain, and source as those used in the RR-1 NASA Validation mission were used in the ground-based tissue preservation study. Mice were evenly divided into one of six groups as shown in  Figure S6 . The mice in groups 1–4 were euthanized with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol) as in RR-1 ( Choi et al., 2020 ), then subjected to various preservation protocols to evaluate the phenomena observed in RR-1 NASA carcass and immediate liver samples. Livers and quadriceps were dissected immediately after euthanasia from mice in group 1. These tissues were divided into thirds and preserved in one of three ways: (1) freezing in dry ice to mimic the cold stowage container that was used to freeze the immediate liver samples in the RR-1 mission, (2) submersion in LN2, or (3) with RNA later . After preservation, all tissues were stored at −80°C until further processing. Although it is a common practice to dissect mice immediately after euthanasia, due to limitations in crew time for spaceflight experiments, immediate dissection is not always possible. Thus, most tissues are preserved  in situ  within the carcass. We therefore sought to determine the most effective way to preserve carcasses that would minimize unintended gene expression changes in tissues preserved  in situ . Mice in groups 2–4 were used to test three different carcass preservation methods: (1) slow freezing in dry ice (DI) to mimic the most common method of carcass preservation used in RR missions to date, (2) snap freezing by submersion in liquid nitrogen (LN2), and (3) segmenting the carcass into thirds and preserving in RNA later , mimicking the preservation method used in the Rodent Research-7 mission. After preservation, all carcasses were stored at −80°C until further processing. Carcasses from mice in groups 2–4 were partially thawed, and quadriceps and livers were dissected, then snap frozen, and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction to mimic the protocol most commonly implemented when carcasses return from spaceflight missions, including RR-1. A summary of all liver and quadriceps tissues evaluated in the present ground-based tissue preservation study are summarized in  Tables S1  and  S2 , respectively. Total RNA was extracted from all liver and quadriceps tissue samp",

  "discussion": "Discussion Herein, we show that protocols used to preserve mouse carcasses on-orbit have large effects on gene expression patterns as measured by RNAseq. Indeed, changes in gene expression due to preservation condition overwhelmed those due to spaceflight. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that many GO terms enriched due to carcass preservation were involved in RNA processing. This correlated with reduced transcript integrity (relatively poor coverage of the 5′ end of transcripts) in samples from carcasses preserved on-orbit when these were sequenced with a polyA enrichment RNAseq protocol. Although RNAseq following polyA selection can more efficiently quantify gene expression ( Kumar et al., 2017 ), ribodepletion methods are more effective on degraded RNA samples ( Li et al., 2014 ;  Schuierer et al., 2017 ). However, although the RNA used in this study was of good quality (RIN >7), we observed a severe bias in transcript coverage following polyA selection depending upon the tissue preservation condition utilized. Specifically, samples taken from carcasses that were slow-frozen on-orbit exhibited a lower 5′ to 3′ coverage ratio as compared with samples taken from immediately dissected tissues. Although resequencing of the carcass flight samples with a ribodepletion protocol produced a more even 5′ to 3′ coverage ratio, our follow-on studies that directly compared slow carcass freezing with immediate dissection revealed a similar (albeit reduced) 5′ to 3′ coverage bias. Taken together, this suggests that slow carcass freezing causes transcript degradation that in-turn leads to reduced 5′ coverage. mRNA degradation starts with the removal of the polyA tail, at which point degradation continues either from the 3′ end  via  the exosome complex or the 5′ end following removal of the 5′-methylguanosine cap. Deadenylation of cytoplasmic mRNA is the rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation and is catalyzed by one of two complexes: the CCR4-NOT complex, which consists of 10 subunits (CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT6, CNOT6l, CNOT7, CNOT8, CNOT9, CNOT10), and the PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation complex consisting of two subunits (PAN2, PAN3) ( Siwaszek et al., 2014 ). We observed transcriptional changes to multiple subunits in each of these complexes when comparing carcass and immediate samples. Most striking was the coordinated upregulation of both Pan2 and Pan3 in the carcass samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission, which suggests an increase in PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation activity, which could result in loss of polyA tails in some transcripts. This could lead to poor mRNA capture by our polyA enrichment protocol and result in some of the differences seen between the polyA enrichment and ribodepletion protocols. Three proteins—Dcp2 (Nudt20), Nudt3, Nudt16—have decapping activity both  in vitro  and in cells, whereas an additional five—Nudt2, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, Nudt19—have decapping activity  in vitro . In addition, the Dxo family of proteins acts on par",
