  "abstract": "Abstract The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed  in vitro  studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using  Bacillus -based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",

Ancient civilizations used various disinfection methods to remove “pestilence,” from the rudimentary practices of boiling and sunlight exposure to the use of natural substances like vinegar and sulphur [ 1 ]. However, it was not until the 19th century that the age of modern infection control began to take shape with targeted cleaning practices. For example, Ignaz Semmelweis introduced hand disinfection in hospitals [ 2 ], and Florence Nightingale introduced best practices to decrease infection rates and improve patient healing [ 3 ]. In the following decades, the use of carbolic acid by Joseph Lister for surgical instrument sterilization, in conjunction with other antiseptic methods, further enhanced pathogen control in clinical settings [ 4 ]. By the early-to-mid 20th century, the discovery of antibiotics and the development of chemical disinfectants, such as phenol and bleach, provided a newfound defence against infectious agents [ 5 ]. Though antibiotics have been highly successful and saved many lives, the overuse of these drugs has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant  Enterococcus , making traditional antibiotics less effective [ 6 ]. Additionally, pathogens are evolving resistance to biocidal compounds used in traditional cleaning solutions [ 7 ]. However, chemical treatments such as phenol and bleach remain effective despite providing only temporary removal of pathogens on surfaces. To reduce the risks associated with various disinfection cleaning agents, hospitals now more frequently use a variety of cleaning strategies for disinfection, including advanced technologies like exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide vapour [ 8 ]. Despite these powerful treatments, outbreaks of  Clostridioides difficile  [ 9 ] and other antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms [ 10-14 ] have continued to rise within healthcare settings, highlighting the enduring challenge of simultaneously disinfecting an area while avoiding selection for traits that increase pathogenic potential. Reducing the spread of AMR pathogens is a crucial priority for global human health. In 2019, 1.27 million deaths were directly caused by AMR pathogens globally [ 15 ], and they are projected to cause an additional 10 million deaths annually by 2050 [ 16 ]. We must therefore bolster our defences against persistent and emerging pathogens, safeguarding global health and well-being amidst the evolving landscape of microbial threats [ 17 ]. The inability of current hospital disinfection methods to fully combat these challenges emphasizes the crucial need for continuous research, development, and adaptation of infection control methods. Although traditional cleaning methods have helped to reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses in the built environment, using microbes sourced from different environments to inhibit pathogen survival and transmission is an intriguing new tool that is posed to further improve the health of people indoors. Reintroducing specific microbes into buildings can potentially revolutionize how we prevent the emergence and persistence of unwanted microbes. However, deploying what could be called a microbial biocontrol product is hampered by a lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of action for this ecological strategy to control disease. Despite this knowledge gap, cleaning products containing bacteria that demonstrate antimicrobial activity have been developed [ 18 ] and are already publicly available for purchase.  Bacillus  spores are often used because many species are generally recognized as safe, nonpathogenic, produce a wide variety of antimicrobial compounds [ 19 ], and remain viable over long periods of time [ 20 ]. Though it is unknown how effectively these spores germinate on dry, nutrient-depleted surfaces in built environments, it is important to determine why they are found to be associated with a reduction in the abundance of hospital-associated pathogens [ 21-24 ]. It is unclear whether there is an actual competitive exclusion or inhibition effect or if the spores occupy niches on surfaces, thereby denying this space to pathogens. Alternatively, the spores may mask any detectable signal of the pathogens, as determined via DNA sequencing methods. If the latter is true, this could mean that the pathogens remain viable and can cause infection. Answering this open question and moving the field towards improved public health objectives will require using a diverse suite of experimental and analytical approaches, including techniques that have been so far underutilized in built environment research. In the last decade, there have been critical innovations in the methods, study approaches, and experimental designs used to characterize diversity, survival, distribution, transmission, and health risk of microbes found in our buildings. A rapid explosion in observational studies over the last 15 years has provided a baseline analysis of the microbial diversity in built environments. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes has demonstrated that microbes colonize and spread throughout buildings in predictable ways [ 25-30 ]. In addition, shotgun metagenomic sequencing has been used to characterize the spread of AMR genes [ 31 ] and to quantify the relative abundance of microbial taxa across surfaces and on the skin of indoor environment occupants [ 32 ]. Also, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has been employed to determine the absolute abundance of specific AMR genes [ 33 ,  34 ] or species of interest [ 35 ] in a diverse set of environments such as soil, water, air, faeces, and sediments. Further, targeted and untargeted metabolomics have been employed to characterize the distribution of chemicals around built spaces and infer the metabolic ecology of species interactions in experimental systems and real-world environments [ 36-38 ]. These methods can be enhanced using specialized DNA extraction techniques and internal standards to compensate for the low biomass typically recovered in built environment samples [ 32 ,  39 ,  40 ]. Investigations in real-world built spaces have led to numerous new hypotheses regarding microbial survival and transmission, and the metabolic interactions that underpin these properties. Robustly testing these hypotheses has required innovations in experimental laboratory-based studies. Despite laboratories being built spaces themselves, recreating the inherent ecological dynamics that define the indoor microbiome has proven difficult and has required a reimagining of traditional microbiology techniques. Microbes in the built environment are generally assumed to be starving, dying, or dead [ 41 ]. We are, therefore, attempting to study life on the edge of survival. Many microorganisms are unable to survive on surfaces, but some pathogens have demonstrated the ability to survive on surfaces common to the built environment. For example, MRSA shows robust viability on surfaces such as vinyl and plastic over days [ 42 ]. Traditional microbiology cultivates microbes using media optimized over decades of experimentation to encourage their growth. Such conditions are unlikely to replicate microbial interactions in the built environment. So, it is necessary to use techniques that more closely reproduce the harsh conditions of most built environment surfaces to more accurately examine how microbes survive, grow, and interact in this environment. Observational studies and laboratory investigations inform intervention studies in ways that help determine the potential benefit of removing species of concern or introducing potentially beneficial microbes, both for the integrity of the building structure and the health of the occupants. Intervention studies have been performed in mock built environment microcosms, as well as in full-scale field trials, and are now elucidating the ecological dynamics of these environments. Unfortunately, due to the cost and added risk of conducting an intervention within buildings such as hospitals, only a few full-scale tests of these intervention techniques have been completed. This review will discuss recent advances in built environment microbiome research, with a focus on strategies related to the understanding and translation of biocontrol practices used to reduce antibiotic-resistant pathogens on surfaces in real-world clinical settings. Techniques for investigating the microbiome of the built environment Observational studies have investigated microbial dynamics in the built environment, detecting broad trends in the microbial composition and indoor ecological dynamics. For example, these studies describe how the diversity, composition, and functional potential of communities change over time and how occupants and building operations influence these interactions. Many built environments have been explored in this way, including workplaces [ 43-45 ], homes [ 46-49 ], and public transportation [ 50 ,  51 ]. Of critical importance to understanding the interaction between surface-associated microbial ecology and pathogenic activity, hospital environments have been well characterized [ 25 ,  26 ,  52 ], providing some of the most compelling results to justify further intervention studies. For example, one investigation demonstrated that surfaces in a newly built hospital were inoculated with microbes that closely resembled the outside environment [ 25 ]. However, when that hospital became operational and therefore densely populated with patients and healthcare workers, the surface-associated microbiome began to resemble that of the occupants’ skin and respiratory tract. In addition, following the start of operational activity, hospital custodians cleaned surfaces with defined periodic frequency, which also influences microbial dynamics [ 25 ]. Similar trends have been observed in studies that focused on closed hospital wards that were renovated and reopened for use [ 27 ]. Using metagenomic reconstruction of bacterial genomes in hospitals over dense time series has demonstrated that bacteria in the hospital environment have increased selection pressure for the acquisition and accumulation of antimicrobial resistance genes [ 25 ]. Although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated, bacterial adaptation and resistance to disinfectants (such as those used to clean the hospital) is well known [ 53 ], and we hypothesize that genetic adaptation to survival against such disinfection may also be concomitant with other genetic survival strategies, such as antimicrobial resistance. However, further research is needed to uncover the explicit relationship between these phenomena. Over the last 15 years, observational studies have generally applied relatively affordable microbiome analysis techniques, such as 16S rRNA or ITS gene sequencing, to characterize the diversity and taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities, and qPCR of targeted genes to determine absolute abundances of microbial community members [ 54-58 ]. Although approaches such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and application of qPCR to quantify a variety of genes and microbial activity (e.g. the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes) can dramatically increase experimental costs, they can significantly improve our understanding of microbial interactions in these settings [ 59-61 ]. These methods can be implemented to identify patterns of microbial metabolism in complex systems [ 62 ], or when observed over time, these data can reveal temporal dynamics. However, the implementation of these other ‘omics approaches is challenging due to the low microbial biomass found on surfaces in buildings, especially where resources such as water, carbon, nitrogen, and other essential nutrients to sustain life are limited and there is frequent cleaning [ 41 ,  45 ]. Additionally, although observing spatial or temporal trends in microbiome composition or metabolism is useful, it is hard to identify the features that influence these dynamics due to our inability to control for every factor in a real-world environment. Targeted interventions or manipulations of the environment and the subsequent measurement of the magnitude of effect are needed to better understand how to optimize beneficial change. Even in an observational study such as the Hospital Microbiome Project [ 25 ], where we can observe a pseudo-intervention, in this case a change in occupancy status in real-time, it is not possible to explicitly track the movement of individual microbes or infer microbial metabolic interactions and competitive dynamics. However, it is possible to predict how microbes interact with each other and model their behaviour in these environments using metabolic models [ 63 ]. Modelling microbial metabolism To improve our understanding of microbial activity and ecology in these extreme environments, it is necessary to fundamentally understand their metabolic potential. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) are mathematical models of metabolic networks reconstructed from the organism’s annotated genome [ 63 ,  64 ]. Genome-scale metabolic modelling can help facilitate a clear understanding of the mechanisms that microbes deploy to survive, germinate, and compete for resources. These models predict growth rates in a simulated medium and determine what reaction rates are needed to support growth. Pairs or larger groups of models can be connected to determine which metabolites are being readily exchanged (commensally or symbiotically) and which limited nutrients drive competition between the organisms [ 65 ,  66 ]. These models can make predictions for hundreds of conditions within seconds, allowing for the rapid identification of important nutrients, uptakes, and secretions, thereby rationally informing the design of subsequent experiments. In an iterative process, experimental data can be incorporated into GSMMs, contextualizing the data and further refining their predictions. Transcriptomics can also be used to detect reactions associated with low-transcription genes, increasing the specificity of the model to the environment of interest [ 67 ]. The refined model then yields insights into the biological relevance of transcriptional changes by identifying how they affect the expression of larger metabolic pathways. These models can also facilitate the analysis of multiomics data, by integrating them into an interpretable scaffold, which can then be used to predict how changes in the genome or to the environment influence survival or competitive outcomes. Using these modelling techniques on samples from the International Space Station, an extreme built environment revealed beneficial interactions between the pathogen  Klebsiella pneumoniae  and bacterial species of the genus  Pantoea  and the family  Enterobacteriaceae  [ 68 ]. The model also predicted  K. pneumoniae  is parasitic towards the fungal genus  Aspergillus , which was confirmed experimentally via co-culture [ 68 ]. Predicting microbial interactions in built environments via modelling is a powerful technique to inform efficacious biocontrol strategies by identifying novel species interactions and predicting their differential effect in a range of scenarios. This information can be generated based solely on ‘omics data and subsequently confirmed in laboratory studies. Interpreting metabolic ecology Studies in controlled laboratory settings typically, but not always [ 69 ], use microcosms that contain small pieces of construction materials relevant to the built environment of interest, and conditions (e.g. humidity and temperature) are varied to determine whether they have an effect on microbial activity and survival. To mimic realistic microbial community interactions and successional dynamics, studies have seeded surface materials with microbes by leaving them exposed within built environments prior to initiating challenge studies. In a study of microbial metabolic dynamics [ 60 ], coupons of oriented strand board, medium-density fibreboard, regular gypsum wallboard, and mould-resistant gypsum were naturally inoculated by passive colonization in homes and in a laboratory. Following this seeding, the coupons were either soaked in water to simulate a water leak or kept dry and then all coupons were incubated for an additional 30 days within a high humidity (~94%) chamber. Swabs of the coupons were collected every 5 days and analysed with 16S/ITS rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolomics to determine how these communities changed taxonomically and metabolically in response to wetting. Wetted coupons were dominated by the bacterial genera  Bacillus ,  Erwinia , and  Pseudomonas  and the fungal genera  Eurotium  and  Penicillium . When coupons had been wetted,  Bacillus  and  Pseudomonas  species were almost always negatively correlated in relative abundance, suggesting competitive exclusion. Even though  Bacillus  species are known to produce antifungal compounds [ 70-72 ], only the mould-resistant gypsum was dominated by  Bacillus . The antibacterial compounds nigragillin and fumigaclavine C were found in high abundance. They were positively correlated with the presence of  Aspergillus  and negatively correlated with the abundance of  Bacillus  and  Pseudomonas  [ 60 ]. These results suggest that the presence of  Bacillus  is not sufficient to prevent fungal growth on built environment surfaces. Although they did not purposefully inoculate surfaces with  Bacillus , this study suggests that this genus did proliferate when coupons were wetted, but it only dominated on mould-resistant gypsum, which inherently inhibits fungal growth, and as such, the naturally occurring  Bacillus  species may not have antifungal activity. Semi- in vitro  investigations are effective at discovering novel microbial interactions, but ecological dynamics can also be inferred from applying multiomic techniques to controlled building environments. For example, one study characterized the chemical and microbial compositions of two frequently wet surfaces in a residential setting, specifically the kitchen sink and bathroom shower [ 73 ]. This study used a combination of culture-dependent and independent techniques, including transcriptional analysis of the 16S rRNA gene to determine which bacteria were active at the time of sampling, and assessment of both volatile and soluble chemicals to explore the links between the observed microbiota and chemical exudates. This study showed that microbes play a critical role in structuring the chemical profiles of surfaces in built environments, particularly in kitchen sinks and shower stalls. The microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) were predominantly associated with fatty acid processing, and the composition of these mVOCs appeared more stable than that of the microbial communities themselves, which showed variations in response to changing environmental conditions. A second example demonstrated microbial colonization, succession, and viability in a tightly controlled restroom environment [ 61 ]. This study focused on the ecological succession and viability of human-associated microbiota on restroom surfaces, including floors, toilet seats, and soap dispensers. The study demonstrated that a late-successional microbial community develops on restroom surfaces within 5 to 8 hours of decontamination. This community showed remarkable stability over weeks to months, indicating a quick establishment and persistence of specific microbial assemblages. The authors also showed that faecal taxa, particularly those able to enter a dormant phase, can persist for extended periods on restroom",

  "conclusion": "Conclusions and future directions Probiotic intervention studies in hospitals [ 22-24 ,  99 ,  100 ] have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize cleaning approaches in healthcare facilities. However, much is still unknown about their mechanism of action, as well as how additional factors could influence their efficaciousness  in situ . Further investigation of how spores germinate and competitively exclude other microbes in these dry, nutrient-depleted environments is needed for the successful development and broad deployment of probiotic cleaners. To answer these questions, we must use a variety of experimental strategies, including varied application methods (i.e. how the cleaner is applied and at what concentration is the cleaner most effective), inclusion of taxonomically diverse pathogenic microbes at varied concentrations, and a characterization of whole community dynamics in response to cleaner application. These experiments will require highly controlled and easily manipulatable conditions, and therefore, laboratory testing will be essential for determining the relative importance of factors associated with method of use, humidity, nutrient availability, surface material type, and cleaning regimes. Further, simulating transmission events of microbes from surfaces to humans will be needed to more fully understand how probiotic cleaners influence transmission rates of taxa of interest. Differential use patterns of healthcare facilities might alter best practices for probiotic cleaner use. For example, it is unknown how the magnitude of response might vary between different wards or rooms. Patient rooms and bathrooms have been the primary focus of intervention studies; however, other shared spaces, such as hallways or visitor areas, also carry the potential for pathogen accumulation and transmission risk. Additionally, long-term monitoring is crucial to detect whether the pathogens in these environments begin to adapt to this new cleaning method and theref"
