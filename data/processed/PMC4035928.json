  "abstract": "Significance This work documents a previously unreported plant-wide signaling system based on the rapid, long-distance transmission of Ca2+ waves. In the root these waves move through the cortical and endodermal cell layers at speeds of up to 400 Âµm/s, i.e., traversing several cells per second. This Ca2+ wave system correlates with the triggering of molecular responses in distant parts of the plant upon perception of localized (salt) stress. Such propagating Ca2+ waves provide a new mechanism for the rapid integration of activities throughout the plant body.",
