  "abstract": "Introduction Understanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other spaceflight effects. Methods Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1  g  control. Results and discussion An RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments. Relative to onboard 1  g  controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca ++  signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1  g  onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1  g  and microgravity (μ  g ) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized enzymes and proteins. These results uncover microgravity unique transcriptional changes and highlight the validity and importance of an onboard 1  g  control.",

  "full_text": "1 Introduction As an essential part of life support systems for long-duration space missions, plants supplement food as well as purify the air and water ( Fu et al., 2016 ;  De Micco et al., 2023 ). Future colonization efforts will require the ability to grow plants in unfamiliar environments. However, the space environment poses challenges to growing plants. In addition to the difficulties of providing essential requirements for plant growth (light, water, nutrients, etc.), growing plants in space requires the mitigation of unfavorable factors such as altered gas composition, lack of convective currents, and cosmic radiation. It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant adaptations to space. Toward that goal, several spaceflight experiments have examined the global transcriptional changes of plants grown on the International Space Station (ISS). One caveat to these studies is that until recently, lighted habitats for plant experimentation were limited; for ease of handling and setup, several experiments were carried out in Biological Research In Canisters hardware (BRICs), where plants were grown in the dark. Another point of concern is that many spaceflight experiments have employed hardware-matched experiments on Earth as controls; however, it is difficult to replicate all of the stresses that plants may face on the ISS on the ground. Further, while several transcriptional datasets have been generated (accessible through the NASA GeneLab data repository), differences in plant age, tissue type, and growth conditions confound efforts to separate primary responses to microgravity from other spaceflight related stress responses ( Manzano et al., 2022 ;  Olanrewaju et al., 2023 ). A recent meta-analysis by Barker et al. clearly illustrates some of these confounding effects ( Barker et al., 2023 ). The authors showed that the analysis method (RNA-Seq vs. microarrays) was a principal factor leading to variability between datasets as was the hardware utilized for the spaceflight experiments. Nevertheless, focusing only on experiments conducted in BRIC hardware helped uncover common responses. Namely, oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall dynamics, hypoxia, and ROS signaling were Gene Ontology annotations enriched in spaceflight compared to ground controls. A transcriptional profiling study of 12 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware found organ-specific gene expression changes between leaves, hypocotyls, and roots ( Paul et al., 2013 ). Although each tissue exhibited unique responses, cell wall remodeling, touch response, and pathogen responses were common themes among the genes differentially expressed in space. Plant growth is highly responsive to external cues. Two critical cues –light and gravity– have profound influences on the direction and magnitude of plant growth. Plant roots grow down with the gravity vector (positive gravitropism), while the stems grow opposite to the gravity vector (negative gravitropism) and toward light (positive phototropism). On earth, light and gravity work in combination to direct the orientation of the primary axes of growth as well as root and shoot branching and leaf angle, enabling efficient nutrient acquisition and light capture. The relative contribution of each of these cues in regulating plant growth is difficult to disentangle on Earth, where gravity is a constant; the ISS provides an ideal platform to answer such fundamental questions. The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was one of the controlled environment plant growth habitats operational on the ISS for many years ( Brinckmann, 1999 ;  Kittang et al., 2014 ). In addition to providing lighting, regulated air circulation, and ethylene scrubbing, the EMCS was unique in that it consisted of two centrifuge rotors within a growth chamber. Rotor speeds could be varied to impart  g  levels ranging from 0 - 2  g . The EMCS, therefore, afforded researchers the ability to conduct a simultaneous 1  g  control in space as well as to specifically query the effects of partial gravity. Spaceflight experiments utilizing EMCS hardware have attempted to uncouple light and gravity stimuli ( Millar et al., 2010 ;  Vandenbrink et al., 2016 ). Some experiments have examined the transcriptional response of plants to partial  g  levels. We previously reported that a subset of genes differentially expressed in microgravity respond to incremental increases in  g  levels ( Sheppard et al., 2021 ). Other researchers have compared differences in gene expression between Lunar or Martian gravity and onboard 1  g  controls ( Herranz et al., 2019 ;  Villacampa et al., 2021 ). These types of experiments can inform us on plant responses to extraterrestrial habitats and will be important for aiding with long term colonization efforts. In this study, we compare the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis shoots from two independent spaceflight experiments conducted on the ISS. In both experiments, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 5-6 days in the EMCS. The results revealed considerable overlap between the two experiments despite differences in the experimental setup. Furthermore, onboard 1  g  controls facilitated the identification of microgravity-specific differences in gene expression. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preflight ground testing Prior to flight build, optimization was carried out at North Carolina State University with a focus on seed stock viability, experimental protocols, and downstream sample recovery and processing.  Arabidopsis thaliana  Col-0 seed stocks were carefully screened to obtain an average germination of ≥99%, and dissection and processing protocols were developed to recover ≥1μg RNA from ≤3mg input tissue with a high degree of RNA integrity. Seed storage tests were carried out to ensure the viability of sterilized seeds for at least a 6 month period. Preflight testing for Plant Signaling (PS) included a Schedule Test and Operations Verification Test (OVT) at the Norwegian User Support and Operations Center (N-USOC, Trondheim, Norway), in an Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1). Similarly, ahead of the Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) spaceflight, an Experiment Verification Test (EVT) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) in an EMCS ground facility (ERM-2), and an Operations Verification Test (OVT) in the EMCS Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1) at N-USOC were carried out. All preflight and flight preparations for seed, media, and hardware assembly were carried out at NASA ARC. 2.2 Flight experiment preparation PS and PRR were carried out in the EMCS using the experimental unique equipment (EUE)s which are the TROPI-like seed cassettes previously described ( Kiss et al., 2009 ;  Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2019 ). Whatman #3 blotter paper and black-gridded PES membrane (PALL life Sciences Cat. No. 65561) were cut to fit the seed cassettes. Blotter papers were pre-soaked in 0.5X MS media, pH 5.7 (without sucrose) and allowed to dry. Blotter papers and membranes were sterilized by autoclaving. Seeds were surface sterilized and allowed to dry for 2 hours. Healthy viable seeds were selected under a dissecting microscope and attached to the gridded membrane using guar gum. Seeds were positioned with micropyles pointing down (away from lights) with 27 seeds/membrane. Gridded seeded membranes were attached to prepared blotters with guar gum and fixed to cassette base plates. Cassette covers were installed and sealed with foil tape (3M). A total of 80 cassettes were prepared for each experiment. Seed cassettes were assembled for flight at NASA ARC and loaded into experimental containers (ECs) approximately 4 weeks prior to the scheduled flight. 2.3 Spaceflight Onboard the ISS, ECs were loaded into the EMCS by the attending astronaut. Each EC contained 5 seed cassettes for a total of 4 ECs (20 seed cassettes)/centrifuge rotor. Experiments were initiated by hydration, controlled remotely. The experimental timelines for PS and PRR are shown in  \n Figure 1 \n . Both experiments were illuminated by white LEDs along the shoot side of the cassettes, and both experiments consisted of two replicate experimental runs. PS was carried out under continuous light, while PRR employed a long-day light regime (16h light/8h dark). Images were obtained from cameras located within the EMCS chamber. EMCS environmental parameters for PS were set at 21% O 2  and a constant seedling temperature of 24°C. For PS, the ambient cabin air was purged from the EMCS chamber prior to each experimental run so that CO 2  levels gradually increased to equilibrate with the cabin (beginning ~370 ppm and equilibrating to ~760 ppm). EMCS environmental parameters for PRR were set at 21% O 2 , 24°C daytime seedling temperature, and 21°C nighttime seedling temperature. Due to constraints with the upmass of air gas canisters, the EMCS chamber was not purged prior to each run of PRR; chamber CO 2  for the duration of PRR was similar to the ISS cabin (~3000 ppm). In both PS and PRR, environmental factors were monitored by real-time telemetry to record O 2 , CO 2 , seedling temperature, and relative humidity. At the end of the experiments, seed cassettes were removed from the ECs, with 1  g  cassettes handled first, and frozen immediately in the onboard -80°C freezer (MELFI). Seed cassettes remained frozen onboard the ISS. Samples were maintained at cryogenic temperature during return via Space-X Dragon, after splashdown, and until delivery to the laboratory. Samples were then stored at -80°C until processing for RNA. Figure 1 Experimental Timelines of Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR). Seed cassettes were prepared with dry seed and installed into the EMCS hardware on board the ISS. Experiments were initiated by remote hydration (blue arrows), and the two rotors were actuated according to the schedule shown with regular imaging (black arrows). Plant signaling  (A)  employed a constant light schedule while Plant RNA Regulation  (B)  was conducted under a 16/8 hour light/dark schedule, with two staggered hydration events allowing for the simultaneous harvest of 4 day and 6 day old seedlings at the end of the experiment. 2.4 Ground reference controls For both PS and PRR, ground reference experiments were carried out in the ERM-2 at NASA-ARC, using flight build spares and matching environmental parameters to the flight experiments. Briefly, this hardware was designed to replicate environmental conditions experienced aboard the ISS to include temperature, gas composition, and provide comparable support to the flight hardware. Experimental containers (ECs) were positioned in the ERM in an upright position such that seedlings grew vertically, with lighting provided within each seed cassette from above the germinating seedlings, similar to the flight configuration. 2.5 RNA isolation All analyzed shoot samples for the 1  g  controls were from seed cassettes in position 3 of each EC. For PS, position 3 corresponded to 0.76  g  and for PRR position 3 corresponded to 1  g  ( \n Supplementary Figure 1 \n ). For each RNA isolation, seed cassettes were processed singly as follows. A single seed cassette was retrieved from the freezer, and the cover was removed. The cassette base was placed on a chilled platform, and RNA-later (Thermo Fisher Cat. No. AM7021) was added. The seedlings were dissected into root and shoot fractions and stored at 4°C in RNA-later for 24 hours, followed by storage at -20°C until RNA isolation. RNA was isolated from each shoot sample using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Applied Biosystems Cat No. AM1931). RNA recovery and integrity were monitored by Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100). For the PRR shoot samples, the RNA isolation protocol was modified in order to retain the small RNA fraction as well. 2.6 Illumina sequencing Each sample for Illumina Sequencing consisted of RNA isolated from a single seed cassette (each containing 27 seedlings) and each treatment/condition consisted of 3-4 replicates each. PS library preparation and sequencing were carried out by the Genomic Sciences Laboratory at North Carolina State University (Raleigh, NC) as described previously ( Sheppard et al., 2021 ). Libraries were prepared using the ultra-directional library prep kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Sequencing was carried out on 3 lanes of Illumina HiSeq2500 (125 bp single end reads). For PRR, Library preparation and Illumina sequencing for RNA and small RNA (sRNA) was carried out by Novogene Corporation Inc. (Sacramento, CA). 2.7 Data processing and analysis Raw reads were cleaned up to remove adapters and reads shorter than 50 reads by cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 ). Quality control was evaluated by FastQC ( Andrews, 2010 ) to ensure adapters were removed. Reads were aligned using HiSat2 ( Kim et al., 2019 ) to the Arabidopsis genome using TAIR10 ( Lamesch et al., 2012 ) and Araport11 ( Cheng et al., 2017 ) genome annotations (downloaded 08/2018). Read counts per feature were generated using HTseq-Count ( Anders et al., 2015 ). Differential gene expression was determined using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 ). Features with one count or less in any sample were discarded. Differentially expressed genes were filtered on p-values. For the individual analyses of PS and PRR, the significance cutoff was padj <0.05 and for the combined analyses, the cutoff was padj < 0.01. Each sample and condition was represented by 3-4 replicates. Normalized DESeq2 counts tables were visualized as heatmaps using the R package pheatmap (version 1.0.12), clustering by column and scaling by row. To determine whether overlap between individually analyzed PS and PRR DE gene lists were significant and non-random, hypergeometric distribution hypothesis testing was carried out using the phyper function of the R programming language. These analyses assumed a total genome size of 33,603 genes. Similarly, enrichment for HY5 targets in µ  g  DEG lists obtained from the combined PS/PRR dataset was analyzed by the same function, assuming 3,894 putative HY5 binding targets within the genome ( Lee et al., 2007 ). To identify potential upstream regulatory sequences present in the DEGs, a 4th order Markov background model was constructed using the 1kb regions of DNA upstream of all genes found to be differentially regulated in µ  g . Using this model as a background control, MEME analysis ( Bailey et al., 2015 ) examined the 500 bp regions upstream of upregulated genes using the parameters “-mod anr -minw 6 -maxw 8 -p 4 -nmotifs 10 -dna -revcomp” to elicit enriched motifs. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and enrichment was queried using agriGO2 ( Tian et al., 2017 ), ExPath2.0 ( Tseng et al., 2020 ), PANTHER18.0 ( Thomas et al., 2022 ), and PlantGSAD ( Ma et al., 2022 ). PCA variance analysis was performed using variance stabilized counts from the DESeq dds object in ggplot2; this was limited to the top five hundred transcripts ranked by variance. Data was captured from the plotPCA function using ggplot_build. To determine the significance of the correlation between the variables of Age and Gravity Condition and the principal components, we used the package PCAtools R package ( Blighe and Lun, 2023 ). The function eigencorplot was used to visualize and test the significance of the correlation between these two variables and the top six principal components ( \n Supplementary Figure 2 \n ). The comparison was made using Pearson’s correlation, with pairwise.complete.obs, so that the correlation between each pair is evaluated using all paired data for each variable. The Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction was applied. 2.8 Data availability Raw sequence files and metadata for PS and PRR are available at the NASA data repository GeneLab under the accession numbers OSD-223 and OSD-437. 3 Results 3.1 Experimental setup and growth parameters To minimize the impact of handling and transport, seeds were dry-mounted on membranes and remained dormant until hydration at the initiation of each experimental run. The dry seed configuration with an on-orbit hydration also eliminated the need for late loading and allowed for flexibility in the event of flight scrubbing or delayed experiment initiation. Following hydration and illumination, seedlings from PS and PRR germinated with high frequency ( \n Supplementary Table 1 \n ) and exhibited nominal growth across each run of both experiments. Differences in experimental design ( \n Figure 1 \n ) included the presence/absence of a day/night cycle, total experiment length, and centrifugal profiles. Notably, PS incorporated 48 hours of initial 1  g  treatment at the start of the experiment. For the later experiment, PRR, the μ  g  rotor remained stationary for the entire duration of the experiment. A morphological difference was observed between these experiments, characterized by a largely uniform orientation of seedling roots in PS, in contrast to the more disordered growth patterns observed in PRR ( \n Figure 2 \n ). This difference could be due to the initial gravitational cue provided to all seedlings in PS, the presence of a day/night cycle in PRR, or a combination of the two. Despite a small degree of variation from seed cassette to seed cassette, each experiment provided a sufficient amount of healthy plant tissue for downstream analysis, and only those cassettes which exhibited nominal growth and development were selected for downstream analysis ( \n Supplementary Figure 3 \n ). Figure 2 Representative Images of Plant Signaling and Plant RNA Regulation Seed Cassettes. Representative images of seedling morphology across µ  g  and 1  g  conditions taken at the end of each experiment. Digital JPEGs are displayed directly as downlinked from EMCS hardware without alteration. Note that the camera configuration which allowed for close-up imaging provided two images of each seed cassette (left and right side), with partial overlap of each captured image (scale bar = 0.5 cm). 3.2 Differentially expressed genes The individual DE-Seq2 analyses of PS and PRR yielded a significant number of genes that were differentially expressed between microgravity (μ  g ) and the onboard (1  g ) control. In total, we identified 1,819 and 1,792 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PS, and PRR, respectively. The overlap between the two experiments for both μ  g  upregulated and μ  g  downregulated DEG lists was significant ( \n Table 1 \n ). Both experiments shared 178 genes upregulated in µ  g  and 399 genes downregulated in µ  g . GO annotation revealed enrichment of the GO terms, “Regulation of Transcription” and “Auxin Signaling” in the common µ  g  upregulated genes. “Cell Wall” and “Response to Stress” were GO terms enriched in the common µ  g  downregulated genes.

It should be noted that >99% of DEGs identified as common to the two individual datasets listed above were similarly identified by this combined analysis.

  "discussion": "4 Discussion 4.1 Conserved and unique transcriptional changes in microgravity The PS and PRR spaceflight experiments were designed to examine early seedling development and responses to microgravity. To answer these questions, we utilized the EMCS facility with a rotor configuration selected to provide µ  g  and an onboard 1  g  control. The two experiments were conducted at different times and had different lighting regimes as well as some other differences in set up as outlined in  \n Figure 1 \n . Despite these differences, there was considerable parity between the DEGs in µ  g  between the two experiments. Genes upregulated in µ  g  compared to the 1  g  control were primarily involved in leaf and shoot development. The majority of the upregulated TFs function to regulate these processes and the enrichment in auxin and vesicle transport also support growth processes. In contrast, there appears to be a substantial downregulation of both biotic and abiotic stress responses in µ  g . Defense related genes were overrepresented and most of the downregulated TFs function in mediating plant stress responses ( \n Figure 4 \n ). Additionally, we identified specific miRNAs that were differentially regulated in microgravity with coordinate regulation of their putative targets. The large-scale downregulation in microgravity of stress-response related genes in the PS and PRR flight experiments are somewhat at odds with other experiments where flight responses are compared to a ground control on Earth. In fact, we find that genes reported as upregulated in spaceflight appear to be downregulated in our datasets. For instance, 70 genes that were upregulated in spaceflight in BRIC19 ( Choi et al., 2019 ) are downregulated in µ  g  in our dataset. Many of these common genes are associated with response to stress and hypoxia. We do however find more overlap in responses if we examine RNA-Seq datasets from other EMCS spaceflight experiments which utilized onboard 1  g  controls. The Seedling Growth experiments (SG2 and SG3) were conducted in the EMCS; however these experiments included photostimulation with either unidirectional blue ( Herranz et al., 2019 ;  Vandenbrink et al., 2019 ) or red ( Villacampa et al., 2021 ) light for the final 48h of the experimental timeline. Although there was almost no overlap in DEGs upregulated in µ  g ; we do detect considerable overlap with µ  g  downregulated genes as well as genes downregulated in low (<0.1)  g  ( Herranz et al., 2019 ). Comparing our results to Herranz et al. shows that 54 genes were commonly downregulated in µ  g . Furthermore, 143 genes downregulated in low  g  were shared with genes downregulated in µ  g  in our data. Even more pronounced is the similarity in enriched GO terms for genes downregulated in µ  g  and low  g  compared to 1  g  ( Herranz et al., 2019 ) and the genes downregulated in µ  g  in the PS/PRR data. These include, response to stimulus, response to abiotic stimulus and response to stress.",
