  "full_text": "1 Introduction The\ncurrent global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million\ndeath till now. 1 − 4  It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike\nprotein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates\nthe virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which\nis the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells. 5 − 9  Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein became the target for COVID-19\nvaccines available in the market, which can generate neutralizing\nantibodies against the S-RBD upon immunization. 9 − 14  The emergence of double mutant delta (B.1.617.2) variants, which\ncontain the L452R and T478K mutations on the S-RBD, has enhanced the\nbinding affinity with ACE2. 1 − 6  Recent reports also indicate that mutations on the S-RBD lead to\na prominent decline in neutralizing antibody levels against the delta\nvariant by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination. 7 − 12  Due to the above fact, designing a new strategy to block the spike\nprotein–ACE interaction is very important for preventing mutate\nvariant infection. Although the mortality rate is very high\nfor COVID-19, reported\ndata also indicates that around 42% of infected individuals are asymptomatic\ncarriers, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively controlled\nby the human’s innate immune system. 1 − 9  α-Defensin human neutrophil peptides (HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, and\nHNP4) and human β-defensins (HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3) as well as\nLL-37 (leucine-leucine-37) cathelicidin family peptides are members\nof the innate immune system. 11 , 15 − 17  Defensins and cathelicidin peptides play a crucial role in the human\nbody for viral inhibition via binding and destabilizing. 11 , 15 − 17  Driven by the need to block the delta variant infection,\nherein we report the design of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene\nquantum dots (GQDs), which have the capability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and block the S-RBD interaction\nwith ACE2, which prevents the virus entry into the host cells, as\nshown in  Figure  1 . Figure 1 (A) Scheme\nshowing the design of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-conjugated GQDs and binding of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD. (B) Scheme showing the blocking of the S-RBD interaction\nwith ACE2 on a human cell membrane and preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nentry. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) consisting\nof a graphene lattice and\ncontaining single or few sheets of graphene fragments exhibit size-dependent\nluminescence properties originating from the quantum confinement effects\nand edge effects. 18 − 23  GQDs containing different surface groups such as carboxy, epoxy,\nand hydroxyl exhibit a high water solubility, high surface area, excellent\nphotostability, and biocompatibility. 18 − 23  Due to their unique optical and other properties, GQDs became a\nvery good choice for use in bioimaging, biosensing, and other biotechnology\napplications. 18 − 23  In our design, bioconjugated GQD fluorescence has been used to monitor\nthe SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD–host\ncells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction to\ndetermine the effective binding affinity. Also, the functional groups\non the surface and edge of GQDs have been used for the inactivation\nof the virus via decomposition of the lipid membrane of the virus\nand for the removal of spike proteins that are attached on the lipid\nmembrane. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Synthesis\nand Characterization of HNP1 and\nLL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) GQDs were developed in a two-step process, as shown in  Scheme S1  in the Supporting Information. Initially,\ngraphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite\npowder using the modified Hummer’s method as we and others\nhave reported before. 18 − 23  In the next step, GQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method\nin the presence of dimethyl formamide (DMF). 18 − 23  The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reported in  Figure S2A  in the Supporting Information shows\nthe two-dimensional (2D) morphology of the freshly prepared GO with\n5 ± 2 μm size. On the other hand, the TEM image reported\nin  Figure S2B  shows the zero-dimensional\n(0D) morphology of the freshly prepared GQDs whose sizes are 4 ±\n2 nm.  Table S1  shows the dynamic light\nscattering (DLS) measurement data, which matches well with the TEM\ndata. As shown in  Figure  1 A, for the development of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-attached GQDs, we used carbodiimide coupling chemistry between\nthe carboxy group of graphene oxides and the amine group of peptides. The FTIR data from peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in  Figure S2G , shows the presence of the −OH\nstretch, −CH stretch, −amide-I, −amide-II, and\n−amide-III bands, which indicates that the peptides are attached\non the GQD surfaces. The DLS data indicates the ζ-potential\nchanges from −14 ± 2 mV to 3 ± 1 mV after peptide\nbinding, which also indicates that the peptides are on the surface\nof GQDs. The TEM data reported in  Figure  2 A indicates that the size of peptide-conjugated\nGQDs are 6 ± 2 nm, which matches very well with the DLS data\nreported in  Table S1 . The inset in  Figure  2 A shows the high-resolution\nTEM for peptide-conjugated GQDs, which shows the graphite structure\nwith a stripe distance of ∼0.24 nm. 18 − 23  Similarly,  Figure S2C  in the Supporting\nInformation shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, which\nindicates a broad peak at 26.5° due to the (002) reflection of\ngraphite. 18 − 23 Figure S2D  shows the Raman spectra of\npeptide-attached GQDs, which indicate the presence of the D band at\n∼1350 cm –1  and the G band at ∼1590\ncm –1  due to the graphene structure. 18 − 23 Figure 2 (A)\nTEM image of freshly prepared peptide-conjugated GQDs.

The experimental details are reported\nin the  Supporting Information . For the\ndetection of luminescence from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached\nGQDs, in the presence and absence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD, we used a portable fluorescence spectrometer\ndeveloped by us with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser. 13 , 14 , 21 , 22  For emission signal collection, we used a miniaturized QE65000 spectrometer\nfrom Ocean Optics. 13 , 14 , 21 , 22  All measurements were performed with 5 ms\nintegration time with five spectra averaging using the software. 13 , 14 , 21 , 22 2.3 ELISA-like Assay for Determining the Binding\nbetween the Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein and Peptide-Attached\nGQDs For this purpose, we used an ELISA-like assay using\nHis-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins, which were adsorbed\nto a 96-well plate overnight at 4 °C. For comparison with fluorescence\nassay data, we kept the concentrations of GQDs and spike proteins\nthe same for both the measurements. After that, the plate was blocked\nusing a blocking buffer and then different concentrations of peptide-attached\nGQDs were incubated on the plate. In the next step, we used a streptavidin\nprotein that is covalently conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase\n(HRP) enzyme to determine the binding. 11 − 15  We also used TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine)\nfor colorimetric assay detection. 11 − 15  Signal intensity was recorded using a plate reader.\nAfter that, data were graphed in GraphPad Prism. From the binding\ncurve, we estimated the binding constants ( K D ) using the Hill equation, as reported before. 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 2.4 In Vitro Experiments for Blocking ACE2 Binding\nwith Baculovirus Pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2)\nSpike Protein Using Fluorescence Imaging For this experiment,\nwe used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of\nACE2 (HEK-293T). 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  Since delta variant SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, for\nour experiment, we used a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged Baculovirus\npseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein\n(catalog number #C1123G). 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  The experimental details are reported in the  Supporting Information . 2.5 Virus\nInhibition Experiments for HNP1 and\nLL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs For this experiment,\nwe used HEK293T cells. Dilutions of test HNP1 and LL-37 human host\ndefense peptide-attached GQDs were made in DMEM. 13 , 14 , 26 , 27  The GFP-tagged\nBaculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein stock was mixed with the HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-attached GQDs at different concentrations and incubated for\n1 h. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Determining\nthe Photoluminescence Quantum\nYield and Lifetime from HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached\nGQDs The UV–vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human\nhost defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in  Figure S2E , show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed\nat ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π*\ntransition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be\ndue to the n−π* transition. 18 − 23 Figure S2F  and  Figure  2 C show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached\nGQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416\nnm can be due to the electron–hole recombination and quantum\nsize effect. 18 − 23 Figure  2 B shows that\npeptide-attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV\nlight. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to\nbe ∼0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay\nprofiles for peptide-attached GQDs are reported in  Figure  2 D, which fit very well with\nthe triple exponential function with τ 1  = 0.32 ns,\nτ 2  = 2.2 ns, and τ 3  = 7.3 ns. 3.2 Determining the Biocompatibility and Cytotoxicity To determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL-37\nand HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung\ncancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high\nexpression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  All cells were treated with 60 μg/mL GQDs + 4 μg/mL\nLL-37 + 4 μg/mL HNP1 for 48 h. 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  As reported in  Figures S3A,B  in the Supporting\nInformation, after treatment with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly\nchanged for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly\nindicate that the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs do not exhibit\nany detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment. 3.3 Determining the Binding Affinity between the\nSARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and\nLL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs Next, we have\ndetermined whether the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached\nGQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus\ninfection. The experimental details are reported in the  Supporting Information . The luminescence signals\nfrom GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded\nwith a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser. 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  The reported photograph in  Figure  2 B also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide-conjugated\nGQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein. In the\ncase of peptide-attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind\nwith the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding,\nand charge transfer interaction. 18 , 19  On the other\nhand, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via\nhydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction. 11 , 12 , 15  The observed huge fluorescence\nquenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide-attached\nGQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can\nbe the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent\ncomplex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching\ncan be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Förster\nresonance energy transfer from the donor peptide-attached GQDs to\nthe acceptor spike protein. As reported in  Figure  2 D, the photoluminescence decay curve remains\nalmost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (τ 1  = 0.30 ns, τ 2  = 2.2 ns, and τ 3  = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar\nto the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime\ndata clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching\nprocess. Similarly, as reported in  Figure S1E  in the Supporting Information, the UV–vis absorption\nmaximum\nfrom peptide-attached GQDs is ∼10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength\nin the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation\nof a complex in the ground state between the peptide-attached GQDs\nand spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described\nby the Stern–Volmer equation 20 , 22 , 24 , 25  as described below 1 2 where  F 0  is the fluorescence intensity\nfrom the peptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the absence of the spike protein,  F  is the\nfluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike]\nis the protein concentration.  K SV  is the\nStern–Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients\n( K q ) and the lifetime τ 0  of the GQDs’ excited state in the absence of spike. As shown\nin  Figure  2 E, the plot\nof log[ F 0 / F ] versus log[spike\nconcentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs indicates\nthe nonlinear fluorescence quenching process, which may be due to\nthe multiple binding sites. Since we have observed a nonlinear\nStern–Volmer quenching\nprofile, we have used the modified Hill equation 24 , 25 3 where  K b  is the dissociation constant, [ S ] t  is the concentration of the spike protein\nat any\ngiven time, [ G ] t  is the\nconcentration of peptide-conjugated GQDs at any given time, and  n  is the Hill coefficient. We have determined the binding\naffinity, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by fitting\nthe curve with  eq  3 ,\nas reported in  Figures  2 E,G. As shown in  Table  1 , we have determined the binding affinity as 8 ± 1 nM and  n  = 2.6. Table 1 Binding Affinity Measured by Fluorescence\nQuenching and ELISA Assays system GQD-based fluorescence\nquenching ELISA-like assay LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs 8 ± 1 nM 9 ± 1 nM LL-37-attached GQDs 12 ± 1 nM 13\n± 1 nM HNP1-attached GQDs 120 ± 20 nM 116 ± 20 nM LL-37 peptide   16 ± 1 nM HNP1\npeptide   160 ± 40 nM ACE2   8 ± 1 nM GQDs 3.8 ± 0.6 μM 3.2 ± 0.5 μM As shown in  Figures  2 F,G, the luminescence signal from HNP1 human host defense\npeptide-attached\nGQDs decreases slowly as the concentration of the spike protein increases.\nBy fitting the curve using  eq  3 , we have determined the binding affinity as 120 ± 20\nnM in this case, as reported in  Table  1 . To verify our data with a well-documented assay,\nwe used the ELISA-like\nassay using the His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. 26 , 27  The experimental details are reported in the  Supporting Information . As reported in  Figure  2 H, the plot shows the binding curve between\nthe peptide-conjugated GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate-based\nassay. From the binding curve, we have estimated the binding affinity\nas 9 ± 1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs, which matches very well with the fluorescence quenching data.\nSimilarly, we have estimated the binding affinity for the delta variant\nspike with different peptide-conjugated GQDs, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides\nand ACE2, as reported in  Table  1 . From the experimental data, we can conclude that the\nbinding affinities\nfor the delta variant spike with LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs are comparable with that for ACE2-delta variant spike binding.\nAlso, the binding affinities for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs are better than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs. The observed\nhigher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides\n(HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide\ncan be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike\nprotein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported theoretical\nmodeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike-RBD in eight sites\n(LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502). 7 , 11  On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike-RBD in six sites (LYS417,\nALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493). 7 , 11  The\nobserved higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction. During the past three years of pandemic, several new viral lineages\nsuch as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1), delta (B.1.617.2),\nand omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had risen. 1 − 6  To understand how the binding affinity between LL-37 & HNP1-attached\nGQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies,\nwe have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability\nwith peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in  Table  2 , our experimental data indicate that the\nbinding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD is higher\nthan those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD. Table 2 Binding Affinity between the LL-37\n& HNP1-Attached GQDs and SARS-CoV-2 S1 Protein RBD (Different\nVariants) Measured by Fluorescence Quenching and ELISA Assays system GQD-based fluorescence quenching ELISA-like assay alpha B.1.1.7 variant spike-RBD 13 ± 1 nM 14 ± 1 nM beta B.1.351 variant spike-RBD 11 ± 1 nM 11 ± 1 nM gamma P.1 variant spike-RBD 12 ± 1 nM 12 ± 1 nM delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD 8 ± 1 nM 9 ± 1 nM 3.4 Demonstrating ACE2–Spike\nProtein Binding\nBlocking Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2)\nVirus Next, to find out whether LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs can bind with delta variant SARS-CoV-2, we have performed an\nexperiment using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown in  Figure  3 A, the luminescence intensity from peptide-attached\nGQDs decreases abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates\nthat LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with Baculovirus\npseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Figure 3 (A) Fluorescence spectra from HNP1 and LL-37\npeptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the presence and absence of GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped\nwith a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein.

(D–H)\nInhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the surface of HEK-293T\ncells expressing ACE2. The green fluorescence is due to the presence\nof GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein on the surface of HEK-293T cells expressing\nACE2. (D) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of\nGFP-tagged pseudotyped delta virus without GQDs. (E) Bright-field\nimage of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged Baculovirus\npseudotyped without GQDs. (F) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells\nin the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-attached GQDs. (G) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells in\nthe presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1 human\nhost defense peptide-attached GQDs. (H) Bright-field image of HEK-293T\ncells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1\nhuman host defense peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in  Figure  3 B,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide-conjugated GQDs\nare bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide-\nand HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached\nGQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the\nvirus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine\nwhether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability\nto prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking\nthe spike protein RBD–ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic\nkidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). For this\nexperiment, we have used GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a\nSARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number\n#C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the  Supporting Information . 26 , 27  As shown in  Figure  3 D, in the absence of peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta\nvariant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green\nfluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus\nparticles on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2.  Figure  3 E shows the bright-field\nimage of HEK-293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped\nvirus on the cell surface. As shown in  Figure  3 H, in the presence of LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on\nHEK-293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence. Since LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have high binding affinity\nwith the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates\nthat they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2\nand the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand,\nas reported in  Figures  3 F,G, LL-37 peptide-attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot\ncompletely block the virus spike protein–ACE2 binding. As reported\nin  Figure  4 B, the blocking\ncapability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used.\nAlso, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding\naffinity, as reported in  Table  1 .

The experimental details are reported in\nthe  Supporting Information . 13 , 14 , 26 , 27 Figure  4 B shows the\n% inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved\nin the case of LL-37 (4 μg/mL) and HNP1 (4 μg/mL)-attached\nGQDs (30 μg/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition\nwas achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. The\nreported data in  Table  3  and  Figure  4 B also\nindicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL)\npeptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly, using\nonly the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition.\nFrom the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition\nefficiencies for LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are much higher than\nonly one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To\nunderstand better about the above experimental observation, we have\nalso performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL-37 and HNP1-attached\nGQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in  Figure  4 C and the TEM image\nin  Figure  4 D clearly\nshow that LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane\nof Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses\nand spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed.\nThe above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.

We have demonstrated that peptide-attached GQD-based fluorescence\nquenching can be used for determining the binding affinity of the\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. The reported experimental\ndata show that the effective binding affinity between the HNP1 and\nLL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs and delta variant spike protein is comparable\nwith the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity. Using the alpha,\nbeta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, we have shown that the binding\naffinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for\nother variants. Our experimental observation using the HEK293T-human\nACE2 cell line demonstrated that LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells and the inhibition\nefficiency for two peptide-attached GQDs is much higher than those\nfor only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptides or GQDs.",
  "introduction": "1 Introduction The\ncurrent global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million\ndeath till now. 1 − 4  It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike\nprotein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates\nthe virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which\nis the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells. 5 − 9  Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein became the target for COVID-19\nvaccines available in the market, which can generate neutralizing\nantibodies against the S-RBD upon immunization. 9 − 14  The emergence of double mutant delta (B.1.617.2) variants, which\ncontain the L452R and T478K mutations on the S-RBD, has enhanced the\nbinding affinity with ACE2. 1 − 6  Recent reports also indicate that mutations on the S-RBD lead to\na prominent decline in neutralizing antibody levels against the delta\nvariant by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination. 7 − 12  Due to the above fact, designing a new strategy to block the spike\nprotein–ACE interaction is very important for preventing mutate\nvariant infection. Although the mortality rate is very high\nfor COVID-19, reported\ndata also indicates that around 42% of infected individuals are asymptomatic\ncarriers, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively controlled\nby the human’s innate immune system. 1 − 9  α-Defensin human neutrophil peptides (HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, and\nHNP4) and human β-defensins (HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3) as well as\nLL-37 (leucine-leucine-37) cathelicidin family peptides are members\nof the innate immune system. 11 , 15 − 17  Defensins and cathelicidin peptides play a crucial role in the human\nbody for viral inhibition via binding and destabilizing. 11 , 15 − 17  Driven by the need to block the delta variant infection,\nherein we report the design of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene\nquantum dots (GQDs), which have the capability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and block the S-RBD interaction\nwith ACE2, which prevents the virus entry into the host cells, as\nshown in  Figure  1 . Figure 1 (A) Scheme\nshowing the design of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-conjugated GQDs and binding of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD. (B) Scheme showing the blocking of the S-RBD interaction\nwith ACE2 on a human cell membrane and preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nentry. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) consisting\nof a graphene lattice and\ncontaining single or few sheets of graphene fragments exhibit size-dependent\nluminescence properties originating from the quantum confinement effects\nand edge effects. 18 − 23  GQDs containing different surface groups such as carboxy, epoxy,\nand hydroxyl exhibit a high water solubility, high surface area, excellent\nphotostability, and biocompatibility. 18 − 23  Due to their unique optical and other properties, GQDs became a\nvery good choice for use in bioimaging, biosensing, and other biotechnology\napplications. 18 − 23  In our design, bioconjugated GQD fluorescence has been used to monitor\nthe SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD–host\ncells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction to\ndetermine the effective binding affinity. Also, the functional groups\non the surface and edge of GQDs have been used for the inactivation\nof the virus via decomposition of the lipid membrane of the virus\nand for the removal of spike proteins that are attached on the lipid\nmembrane.",
  "methods": "2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Synthesis\nand Characterization of HNP1 and\nLL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) GQDs were developed in a two-step process, as shown in  Scheme S1  in the Supporting Information. Initially,\ngraphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite\npowder using the modified Hummer’s method as we and others\nhave reported before. 18 − 23  In the next step, GQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method\nin the presence of dimethyl formamide (DMF). 18 − 23  The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reported in  Figure S2A  in the Supporting Information shows\nthe two-dimensional (2D) morphology of the freshly prepared GO with\n5 ± 2 μm size. On the other hand, the TEM image reported\nin  Figure S2B  shows the zero-dimensional\n(0D) morphology of the freshly prepared GQDs whose sizes are 4 ±\n2 nm.  Table S1  shows the dynamic light\nscattering (DLS) measurement data, which matches well with the TEM\ndata. As shown in  Figure  1 A, for the development of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-attached GQDs, we used carbodiimide coupling chemistry between\nthe carboxy group of graphene oxides and the amine group of peptides. The FTIR data from peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in  Figure S2G , shows the presence of the −OH\nstretch, −CH stretch, −amide-I, −amide-II, and\n−amide-III bands, which indicates that the peptides are attached\non the GQD surfaces. The DLS data indicates the ζ-potential\nchanges from −14 ± 2 mV to 3 ± 1 mV after peptide\nbinding, which also indicates that the peptides are on the surface\nof GQDs. The TEM data reported in  Figure  2 A indicates that the size of peptide-conjugated\nGQDs are 6 ± 2 nm, which matches very well with the DLS data\nreported in  Table S1 . The inset in  Figure  2 A shows the high-resolution\nTEM for peptide-conjugated GQDs, which shows the graphite structure\nwith a stripe distance of ∼0.24 nm. 18 − 23  Similarly,  Figure S2C  in the Supporting\nInformation shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, which\nindicates a broad peak at 26.5° due to the (002) reflection of\ngraphite. 18 − 23 Figure S2D  shows the Raman spectra of\npeptide-attached GQDs, which indicate the presence of the D band at\n∼1350 cm –1  and the G band at ∼1590\ncm –1  due to the graphene structure. 18 − 23 Figure 2 (A)\nTEM image of freshly prepared peptide-conjugated GQDs.

The experimental details are reported\nin the  Supporting Information . For the\ndetection of luminescence from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached\nGQDs, in the presence and absence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD, we used a portable fluorescence spectrometer\ndeveloped by us with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser. 13 , 14 , 21 , 22  For emission signal collection, we used a miniaturized QE65000 spectrometer\nfrom Ocean Optics. 13 , 14 , 21 , 22  All measurements were performed with 5 ms\nintegration time with five spectra averaging using the software. 13 , 14 , 21 , 22 2.3 ELISA-like Assay for Determining the Binding\nbetween the Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein and Peptide-Attached\nGQDs For this purpose, we used an ELISA-like assay using\nHis-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins, which were adsorbed\nto a 96-well plate overnight at 4 °C. For comparison with fluorescence\nassay data, we kept the concentrations of GQDs and spike proteins\nthe same for both the measurements. After that, the plate was blocked\nusing a blocking buffer and then different concentrations of peptide-attached\nGQDs were incubated on the plate. In the next step, we used a streptavidin\nprotein that is covalently conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase\n(HRP) enzyme to determine the binding. 11 − 15  We also used TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine)\nfor colorimetric assay detection. 11 − 15  Signal intensity was recorded using a plate reader.\nAfter that, data were graphed in GraphPad Prism. From the binding\ncurve, we estimated the binding constants ( K D ) using the Hill equation, as reported before. 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 2.4 In Vitro Experiments for Blocking ACE2 Binding\nwith Baculovirus Pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2)\nSpike Protein Using Fluorescence Imaging For this experiment,\nwe used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of\nACE2 (HEK-293T). 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  Since delta variant SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, for\nour experiment, we used a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged Baculovirus\npseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein\n(catalog number #C1123G). 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  The experimental details are reported in the  Supporting Information . 2.5 Virus\nInhibition Experiments for HNP1 and\nLL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs For this experiment,\nwe used HEK293T cells. Dilutions of test HNP1 and LL-37 human host\ndefense peptide-attached GQDs were made in DMEM. 13 , 14 , 26 , 27  The GFP-tagged\nBaculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein stock was mixed with the HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-attached GQDs at different concentrations and incubated for\n1 h. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.",
  "results": "3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Determining\nthe Photoluminescence Quantum\nYield and Lifetime from HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached\nGQDs The UV–vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human\nhost defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in  Figure S2E , show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed\nat ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π*\ntransition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be\ndue to the n−π* transition. 18 − 23 Figure S2F  and  Figure  2 C show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached\nGQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416\nnm can be due to the electron–hole recombination and quantum\nsize effect. 18 − 23 Figure  2 B shows that\npeptide-attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV\nlight. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to\nbe ∼0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay\nprofiles for peptide-attached GQDs are reported in  Figure  2 D, which fit very well with\nthe triple exponential function with τ 1  = 0.32 ns,\nτ 2  = 2.2 ns, and τ 3  = 7.3 ns. 3.2 Determining the Biocompatibility and Cytotoxicity To determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL-37\nand HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung\ncancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high\nexpression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  All cells were treated with 60 μg/mL GQDs + 4 μg/mL\nLL-37 + 4 μg/mL HNP1 for 48 h. 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  As reported in  Figures S3A,B  in the Supporting\nInformation, after treatment with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly\nchanged for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly\nindicate that the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs do not exhibit\nany detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment. 3.3 Determining the Binding Affinity between the\nSARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and\nLL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs Next, we have\ndetermined whether the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike\nprotein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached\nGQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus\ninfection. The experimental details are reported in the  Supporting Information . The luminescence signals\nfrom GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded\nwith a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser. 11 − 15 , 26 , 27  The reported photograph in  Figure  2 B also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide-conjugated\nGQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein. In the\ncase of peptide-attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind\nwith the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding,\nand charge transfer interaction. 18 , 19  On the other\nhand, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via\nhydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction. 11 , 12 , 15  The observed huge fluorescence\nquenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide-attached\nGQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can\nbe the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent\ncomplex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching\ncan be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Förster\nresonance energy transfer from the donor peptide-attached GQDs to\nthe acceptor spike protein. As reported in  Figure  2 D, the photoluminescence decay curve remains\nalmost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (τ 1  = 0.30 ns, τ 2  = 2.2 ns, and τ 3  = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar\nto the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime\ndata clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching\nprocess. Similarly, as reported in  Figure S1E  in the Supporting Information, the UV–vis absorption\nmaximum\nfrom peptide-attached GQDs is ∼10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength\nin the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation\nof a complex in the ground state between the peptide-attached GQDs\nand spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described\nby the Stern–Volmer equation 20 , 22 , 24 , 25  as described below 1 2 where  F 0  is the fluorescence intensity\nfrom the peptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the absence of the spike protein,  F  is the\nfluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike]\nis the protein concentration.  K SV  is the\nStern–Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients\n( K q ) and the lifetime τ 0  of the GQDs’ excited state in the absence of spike. As shown\nin  Figure  2 E, the plot\nof log[ F 0 / F ] versus log[spike\nconcentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs indicates\nthe nonlinear fluorescence quenching process, which may be due to\nthe multiple binding sites. Since we have observed a nonlinear\nStern–Volmer quenching\nprofile, we have used the modified Hill equation 24 , 25 3 where  K b  is the dissociation constant, [ S ] t  is the concentration of the spike protein\nat any\ngiven time, [ G ] t  is the\nconcentration of peptide-conjugated GQDs at any given time, and  n  is the Hill coefficient. We have determined the binding\naffinity, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by fitting\nthe curve with  eq  3 ,\nas reported in  Figures  2 E,G. As shown in  Table  1 , we have determined the binding affinity as 8 ± 1 nM and  n  = 2.6. Table 1 Binding Affinity Measured by Fluorescence\nQuenching and ELISA Assays system GQD-based fluorescence\nquenching ELISA-like assay LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs 8 ± 1 nM 9 ± 1 nM LL-37-attached GQDs 12 ± 1 nM 13\n± 1 nM HNP1-attached GQDs 120 ± 20 nM 116 ± 20 nM LL-37 peptide   16 ± 1 nM HNP1\npeptide   160 ± 40 nM ACE2   8 ± 1 nM GQDs 3.8 ± 0.6 μM 3.2 ± 0.5 μM As shown in  Figures  2 F,G, the luminescence signal from HNP1 human host defense\npeptide-attached\nGQDs decreases slowly as the concentration of the spike protein increases.\nBy fitting the curve using  eq  3 , we have determined the binding affinity as 120 ± 20\nnM in this case, as reported in  Table  1 . To verify our data with a well-documented assay,\nwe used the ELISA-like\nassay using the His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. 26 , 27  The experimental details are reported in the  Supporting Information . As reported in  Figure  2 H, the plot shows the binding curve between\nthe peptide-conjugated GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate-based\nassay. From the binding curve, we have estimated the binding affinity\nas 9 ± 1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs, which matches very well with the fluorescence quenching data.\nSimilarly, we have estimated the binding affinity for the delta variant\nspike with different peptide-conjugated GQDs, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides\nand ACE2, as reported in  Table  1 . From the experimental data, we can conclude that the\nbinding affinities\nfor the delta variant spike with LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs are comparable with that for ACE2-delta variant spike binding.\nAlso, the binding affinities for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs are better than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs. The observed\nhigher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides\n(HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide\ncan be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike\nprotein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported theoretical\nmodeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike-RBD in eight sites\n(LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502). 7 , 11  On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike-RBD in six sites (LYS417,\nALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493). 7 , 11  The\nobserved higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction. During the past three years of pandemic, several new viral lineages\nsuch as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1), delta (B.1.617.2),\nand omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had risen. 1 − 6  To understand how the binding affinity between LL-37 & HNP1-attached\nGQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies,\nwe have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability\nwith peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in  Table  2 , our experimental data indicate that the\nbinding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD is higher\nthan those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD. Table 2 Binding Affinity between the LL-37\n& HNP1-Attached GQDs and SARS-CoV-2 S1 Protein RBD (Different\nVariants) Measured by Fluorescence Quenching and ELISA Assays system GQD-based fluorescence quenching ELISA-like assay alpha B.1.1.7 variant spike-RBD 13 ± 1 nM 14 ± 1 nM beta B.1.351 variant spike-RBD 11 ± 1 nM 11 ± 1 nM gamma P.1 variant spike-RBD 12 ± 1 nM 12 ± 1 nM delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD 8 ± 1 nM 9 ± 1 nM 3.4 Demonstrating ACE2–Spike\nProtein Binding\nBlocking Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2)\nVirus Next, to find out whether LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs can bind with delta variant SARS-CoV-2, we have performed an\nexperiment using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown in  Figure  3 A, the luminescence intensity from peptide-attached\nGQDs decreases abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates\nthat LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with Baculovirus\npseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Figure 3 (A) Fluorescence spectra from HNP1 and LL-37\npeptide-conjugated\nGQDs in the presence and absence of GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped\nwith a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein.

(D–H)\nInhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the surface of HEK-293T\ncells expressing ACE2. The green fluorescence is due to the presence\nof GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant\n(B.1.617.2) spike protein on the surface of HEK-293T cells expressing\nACE2. (D) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells in the presence of\nGFP-tagged pseudotyped delta virus without GQDs. (E) Bright-field\nimage of HEK-293T cells in the presence of GFP-tagged Baculovirus\npseudotyped without GQDs. (F) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells\nin the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 human host defense\npeptide-attached GQDs. (G) Fluorescence image of HEK-293T cells in\nthe presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1 human\nhost defense peptide-attached GQDs. (H) Bright-field image of HEK-293T\ncells in the presence of GFP-tagged virus bound with LL-37 & HNP1\nhuman host defense peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in  Figure  3 B,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide-conjugated GQDs\nare bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide-\nand HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached\nGQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the\nvirus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine\nwhether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability\nto prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking\nthe spike protein RBD–ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic\nkidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). For this\nexperiment, we have used GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a\nSARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number\n#C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the  Supporting Information . 26 , 27  As shown in  Figure  3 D, in the absence of peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta\nvariant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green\nfluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus\nparticles on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2.  Figure  3 E shows the bright-field\nimage of HEK-293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped\nvirus on the cell surface. As shown in  Figure  3 H, in the presence of LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on\nHEK-293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence. Since LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have high binding affinity\nwith the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates\nthat they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2\nand the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand,\nas reported in  Figures  3 F,G, LL-37 peptide-attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot\ncompletely block the virus spike protein–ACE2 binding. As reported\nin  Figure  4 B, the blocking\ncapability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used.\nAlso, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding\naffinity, as reported in  Table  1 .

The experimental details are reported in\nthe  Supporting Information . 13 , 14 , 26 , 27 Figure  4 B shows the\n% inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved\nin the case of LL-37 (4 μg/mL) and HNP1 (4 μg/mL)-attached\nGQDs (30 μg/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition\nwas achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. The\nreported data in  Table  3  and  Figure  4 B also\nindicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL)\npeptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly, using\nonly the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition.\nFrom the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition\nefficiencies for LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are much higher than\nonly one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To\nunderstand better about the above experimental observation, we have\nalso performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL-37 and HNP1-attached\nGQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in  Figure  4 C and the TEM image\nin  Figure  4 D clearly\nshow that LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane\nof Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)\nspike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses\nand spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed.\nThe above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.

  "conclusion": "4 Conclusions In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL-37\npeptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus\nentry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with\nACE2. We have demonstrated that peptide-attached GQD-based fluorescence\nquenching can be used for determining the binding affinity of the\ndelta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. The reported experimental\ndata show that the effective binding affinity between the HNP1 and\nLL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs and delta variant spike protein is comparable\nwith the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity. Using the alpha,\nbeta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, we have shown that the binding\naffinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for\nother variants. Our experimental observation using the HEK293T-human\nACE2 cell line demonstrated that LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated\nGQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta\nvariant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells and the inhibition\nefficiency for two peptide-attached GQDs is much higher than those\nfor only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptides or GQDs."
