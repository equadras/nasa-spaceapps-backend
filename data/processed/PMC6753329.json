  "abstract": "The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4 +  T cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.",

  "full_text": "Introduction The spaceflight environment poses significant challenges to multiple organ systems. Microgravity exposure leads to a cephalad fluid shift ( Foux et al., 1976 ;  Thornton et al., 1987 ) as well as osteopenia ( Lang et al., 2004 ) and sarcopenia ( LeBlanc et al., 2000 ). Spaceflight alters electrolyte balance ( Vorobiev et al., 1995 ) as well as endocrine ( Stowe et al., 2003 ,  2011 ), vision ( Zhang and Hargens, 2018 ) and baroreflex processes ( Fritsch et al., 1992 ;  Buckey et al., 1996 ;  Meck et al., 2001 ). Cardiovascular changes include stiffening of the carotid arteries as seen in astronauts returning from a 6-month ISS mission ( Hughson et al., 2016 ) and transient changes in heart rate variability ( Yamamoto et al., 2015 ). Spaceflight also may lead to CNS changes including a decline in cognitive performance ( Eddy et al., 1998 ). Immune system dysregulation also occurs, characterized by altered immune cell function and reactivation of viruses ( Crucian et al., 2015 ,  2018 ;  Mehta et al., 2017 ). These findings from astronauts are the main motivation to study rodents flown into space with the rationale that rodents are used extensively to model human conditions on Earth and may prove useful for understanding mechanisms and anticipating human responses to spaceflight. However, limited opportunities for rodent spaceflight studies, along with other challenges of conducting microgravity experiments, stimulated interest in using ground-based rodent models of weightlessness. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model was developed initially to simulate the responses of the musculoskeletal system to microgravity ( Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987 ;  Morey-Holton et al., 2005 ;  Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016 ). To date, its use has expanded to study the responses of other organ systems to spaceflight, including immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system ( Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016 ). The HU model also is utilized to study disorders on Earth such as osteopenia and sarcopenia because features of the HU model mimic bedrest and disuse. Initial efforts to generate a rodent model for musculoskeletal unloading entailed use of a back harness for inducing a cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse of the hindlimbs in singly housed animals ( Morey, 1979 ), which was then developed further to introduce tail suspension which improved outcomes ( Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987 ). This system employs non-invasive attachment of the tail via orthopedic traction tape onto a pulley system that allows for elevation of the hindlimbs; application with the custom-designed cage enables free movement of the animal about the cage ( Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002 ;  Morey-Holton et al., 2005 ). Since then, other variants of the HU system emerged and include partial unloading of all four limbs using a custom body harness ( Wagner et al., 2010 ;  Ellman et al., 2013 ;  Mortreux et al., 2018 ), various methods to induce unloading such as surgical piercing of the tail, alternative taping methods, simplified cage systems that restrict movement, and group housing ( Ferreira et al., 2011 ;  Maurel et al., 2016 ). Single versus social housing of rodents under standard, ambulatory conditions, can differentially impact multiple organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous system) known also to be affected by spaceflight ( Beisel and Talbot, 1987 ;  Schmitt and Schaffar, 1993 ;  D’Aunno et al., 2003 ;  Migeotte et al., 2003 ;  Pierson et al., 2005 ;  Hughson et al., 2016 ;  Mehta et al., 2017 ). Social isolation causes anxiety and depressive-like behavior ( Djordjevic et al., 2012 ), disrupted circadian rhythms ( Spani et al., 2003 ), deficits in memory ( McLean et al., 2010 ), activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors and impairments in antioxidant responses in the brain ( Djordjevic et al., 2015 ). Social isolation also can stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ( Jessop and Bayer, 1989 ;  Ros-Simo and Valverde, 2012 ;  Shetty and Sadananda, 2017 ), the main neuroendocrine regulator of mammalian stress responses ( Bellavance and Rivest, 2014 ). However, other studies report that social isolation can lead to decrements in circulating corticosterone levels ( Djordjevic et al., 2012 ;  Ieraci et al., 2016 ) although it is not clear whether these reflect an initial downregulation of HPA axis activation or simply the induction of a negative feedback loop after a state of activation. In addition, social isolation in rodents leads to impairments in immune function ( Jessop and Bayer, 1989 ;  Clausing et al., 1994 ;  Shanks et al., 1994 ;  Wu et al., 2000 ;  Krugel et al., 2014 ). Social isolation can be a confounding factor for interpreting experimental outcomes from both rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies. In rats, 9 days of spaceflight reduced periosteal bone formation and bone mass (femur dry weights) in singly housed animals but had minimal effect on bone formation or mass in group housed animals ( Morey-Holton et al., 2000 ). In an interesting study,  Tsvirkun et al. (2012)  report that HU (in standard, single housing) or social isolation (without unloading) each can perturb blood pressure and heart rate levels. The possible contribution of social isolation to the biological outcomes of HU has not been studied, leaving a number of knowledge gaps in our understanding of the model for simulating weightlessness. It is unclear whether social interactions (social versus single housing) during HU differentially impacts organ systems known to be responsive to HU. Rodent experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), particularly those making use of the NASA Rodent Research habitat, are conducted in group housed conditions whereas most HU studies conducted to date entail use of the standard, single housed HU model. Other groups have developed variants of the HU model that accommodate social housing in pairs ( Ferreira et al., 2011 ;  Lloyd et al., 2012 ;  Maurel et al., 2016 ). However, characterization of these models in side-by-side studies with the traditional singly housed HU model have not been conducted. Hence, there is value to further developing and characterizing the socially housed HU model for simulating weightlessness to better match rodent habitat conditions on the ISS. Addressing these gaps in knowledge will lead to an improved understanding of the contribution of isolation to observed responses to HU, which in turn will improve the ability to extrapolate HU results to humans in space. To address these knowledge gaps, we aimed to (1) develop a refinement to the NASA Ames HU system, which traditionally entails housing mice in isolation ( Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002 ;  Morey-Holton et al., 2005 ) to enable housing in social pairs and (2) determine the contribution of social isolation to the HU responses of various tissues. We hypothesized that relative to social housing, single housing exacerbates HU-induced dysfunction in select organ systems. To meet these aims and test the hypothesis, we performed a side-by-side comparison of this alternative social HU system versus the standard NASA Ames single housed design and evaluated the responses of select spaceflight-relevant tissues to HU. Materials and Methods Animals and Experiment Design Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition ( National Research Council (U.S.) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (U.S.) and National Academies Press (U.S.), 2011 ). All animal experiments were conducted with prior approval from the NASA Ames Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Sixteen-week old female mice that were to undergo HU were acclimated into HU cages (paired or single housing groups) 3 days prior to the onset of HU ( Figure 1 ). Normally loaded (NL) controls were housed in standard vivarium cages either individually or in pairs. NL controls (either paired or single housing groups) were handled the same way as the HU groups except for the actual attachment of traction tape and tail suspension. Animals were bred at Ames and were wild type littermates of a cross between male mCAT mice [B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-OTC/CAT)4033Prab/J, Jackson Laboratories] ( Schriner et al., 2005 ) and female C57BL/6NJ (Jackson Laboratories). After the acclimation period, animals were suspended onto the pulley apparatus via orthopedic traction tape as described previously ( Wronski and Morey, 1982 ;  Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998 ,  2002 ;  Kondo et al., 2010 ). Responses to the social housing HU model also were evaluated in female C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories), a closely related yet distinct strain. Refer to  Supplementary Section  for further details on the C57BL/6J study. C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ mice differ in competency for nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) expression (C57BL/6J are deletion mutants) ( Freeman et al., 2006 ). Compared to animals with an intact Nnt gene, C57BL/6J mice have higher rates of H 2 O 2  release, spontaneous oxidation of NADPH, and reduced ability to metabolize peroxide ( Ronchi et al., 2013 ). C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ strains also display differences in metabolic phenotypes of muscle and other organs ( Fisher-Wellman et al., 2016 ). FIGURE 1 Experiment design and groups. All animals were supplied with standard rodent laboratory chow (Purina, Cat# 5001) and water  ad libitum . We attempted to measure food intake to gain insight into possible differences in body weight responses. However, accurate measurements could not be made since HU animals generated a substantial amount of food pellet fragments (not consumed) that inadvertently fell through the floor grate and could not be recovered. Enrichment consisted of cotton nestlets (Ancare, Cat# NES3600) refreshed daily. The nestlets were split (cut into two equal parts and stripped half of its thickness) to prevent the mice from building ramp-like structures to load the hindlimbs. Cage and bedding changes were performed weekly. Room temperature was maintained within 23–24°C (higher temperatures can be used) with a 12 h light-12 h dark cycle. After 30 days of HU, animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected from vena cava. Soleus, spleen, and adrenal glands were collected and immediately weighed. Tibiae were recovered and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline solution (FD Neurotechnologies) for ∼24 h at 4°C then transferred to 70% ethanol (Sigma) for storage at 4°C until analysis. Unless otherwise stated, sample sizes (C57BL/6NJ) are as follows: Single NL = 8; Single HU = 6; Social NL = 12; and Social HU = 12. To mitigate any technical artifacts from variations in euthanasia times across groups, one animal from each group was euthanized sequentially, and the sequence repeated until all animals have been euthanized for any given day. All dissections were completed within a 7-h period. Social HU Cage Design and Construction The social housing HU system for mice was generated using commercially available rat/guinea pig polycarbonate cages (Ancare, Cat# R20HT) with filter-top lids (Ancare, Cat# R20MBT). Holes were drilled on the walls of each cage to accommodate two food trays as well as the spouts of two water bottles. Food trays consisted of cryovial holders that were cut to fit into the short side wall of the cage (Nalgene, available from Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 5015-0002). The food tray was attached to each of the two short walls, 5.5 cm above the cage floor. A stainless steel mesh grate (Ancare, Cat# R20SSRWF) was laid out on the cage floor. Bedding was then placed such that it filled two thirds of the space between the cage bottom and the steel mesh grate. In our experience, adding more bedding is not ideal because animals tend to move the bedding to form mounds that come in contact with their hindlimbs. The grid of the ventilated cage lid was sawed out to create an open top. Using a drill, openings were created on one long side of the cage wall to install two spring attachments which were used to secure two water bottles (one for each animal). The spouts of these water bottles were routed into the cage 5.5 cm from the cage floor by drilling openings on the cage wall. Two rods were attached to the cage lids using binder clips to support two pulley systems (one for each animal). The distance that the pulley apparatus can be moved by the animals along the suspended rod was adjusted carefully, using rubber washers to ensure that loading of the hindlimbs do not occur from contact with cage walls or the water sipper ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). In addition, the two suspension rods were placed at an optimal distance from each other so that cephalad regions of the animals can come in contact while avoiding entanglement of the two sets of suspension apparatus ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). To prevent loading of the hindlimbs while being weighed, HU animals were kept suspended on a small hook apparatus set over a lab animal balance as described in  Morey-Holton and Globus (2002) . Microcomputed Tomography Microarchitecture of the cortical and cancellous compartments of the tibia was quantified by μCT using the SkyScan 1272 system (Bruker). For cancellous bone morphology, the proximal tibia was scanned at 3.5 μm resolution. A 400 μm region of interest was 3D reconstructed with a 450 μm offset from the proximal growth plate. This region was auto-contoured using SkyScan CT Analyzer (CTAn) Software (Bruker) to select for the cancellous region. Cancellous parameters such as Bone Volume (BV, mm 3 ), Tissue Volume (TV, mm 3 ), percent Bone Volume (BV/TV, %), Trabecular Spacing (Tb.Sp, mm), Trabecular Thickness (Tb.Th, mm), and Trabecular Number (Tb.N, 1/mm) were quantified following standard μCT guidelines ( Bouxsein et al., 2010 ). For the analysis of cortical bone microstructure, the tibia was scanned at 12 μm resolution. A 300 μm region that was 200 μm proximal to the tibio-fibular junction (TFJ) was auto-contoured to analyze cortical bone parameters such as Marrow Area (Ma.Ar, mm 2 ), Cortical Area (Ct.Ar, mm 2 ), Endocortical Perimeter (Ec.Pm, mm), Periosteal Perimeter (Ps.Pm, mm), and Cortical Thickness (Ct.Th, mm). Flow Cytometry Analysis of White Blood Cells Flow cytometric analysis of white blood cells (WBC) isolated from C57BL/6NJ was performed, as described previously ( Paul et al., 2017 ). Briefly, peripheral blood was collected and centrifuged at 2000× g  for 15 min and plasma removed. Red blood cell lysis buffer at 1X dilution (eBioscience) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker followed by addition of 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline Solution (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then centrifuged at 500× g  for 5 min at 4°C to pellet out the WBC, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min on ice, washed, and incubated with Fc block (CD16/32 Block) for 20 min, followed by probing with anti-CD45-FITC, anti-CD4-PE, anti-CD8a-PerCP, anti-CD11b-PECy5, and anti-Ly6G-PE antibodies (all purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were then washed twice in 1X PBS, and acquired using a Guava Flow Cytometer (Millipore). Unstained and single stained compensation controls were used during acquisition and FlowJo software (version 10.3.0) utilized for cytometric analysis. Measurement of Plasma Corticosterone Levels Peripheral blood was collected from the vena cava and introduced into K3 EDTA tubes (Sarstedt, Cat# 41.1395.105). Centrifugation was performed at 2000× g  at room temperature for 10 min and plasma collected. Plasma was diluted 1:100 and analyzed using a corticosterone ELISA kit (Abcam, Cat# ab108821) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical Analysis Equivalence of variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test. If the variances were equal, two-way analysis of variance was performed. A Tukey  post hoc  test was employed when an interaction effect of  p  < 0.05 was observed. For multi-timepoint measures, repeated measures ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey  post hoc  test. If the variances were unequal, a two-factor linear model with interaction was employed treating the variance with a logarithmic transformation ( Harvey, 1976 ;  Cook and Weisberg, 1983 ;  Aitkin, 1987 ), with a threshold of  p  < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). Data shown are mean ± standard deviation. Results To test the hypothesis that social isolation impacts tissue responses to HU, we developed a refinement of the traditional NASA Ames HU cage design that allows paired housing of animals ( Figure 2 ). We then performed a 30-day HU study under these social housing conditions, side-by-side with animals maintained according to the standard NASA single housing HU system ( Figure 1 ). Animals selected for this study were female C57BL/6NJ mice shown previously to be sensitive to bone loss caused by HU ( Sankaran et al., 2017 ). Controls (normally loaded, NL) were age- and sex-matched animals freely ambulating in standard mouse cages. FIGURE 2 Side view of  (A)  single housing HU and  (B)  social housing HU cage design. To begin to gain insight on whether responses to social housing HU were strain-specific, we also performed a separate 30-day HU experiment in socially housed female C57BL/6J mice ( Supplementary Figures S3 – S8 ), another commonly used strain to study musculoskeletal responses to disuse. Due to logistical constraints, this study had a smaller subset of experimental outcomes and only responses of socially housed NL controls and HU groups were evaluated. Body weights were measured at multiple time points during the HU period. In our experience, a modest weight loss (typically <10%) may occur within a week of HU. In C57BL/6NJ mice, there was a modest yet significant decline in body weights at days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 30 in the socially housed HU group compared to its NL control. At any given day of weighing, the magnitude of the difference in mean body weights of the socially housed HU group relative to its NL control was between 3 and 8%. There were no significant differences in body weights in the singly housed HU cohort versus singly housed NL controls at any time point ( Figure 3  and  Supplementary Table S1 ). We also looked into possible behaviors unique to the NL and HU social housing groups that could contribute to body weight differences. This was done by scoring select time periods in videos taken during the dark and light cycles ( Supplementary Methods ). Huddling, an adaptation that helps conserve body heat and therefore fat reserves, manifested in socially housed NL controls but not in socially housed HU animals. This was because physical contact between socially housed HU animals can only occur via cephalad regions. In addition, we observed a novel behavior wherein socially housed HU mice pass nestlets (enrichment) to or from their cagemates. Socially housed NL controls did not engage in this behavior ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). In C57BL/6J mice, HU animals and their corresponding NL controls did not differ in body weights at any of the time points ( Supplementary Figure S3  and  Supplementary Table S2 ). FIGURE 3 Body weights from day 0 to 30 of hindlimb unloading (HU) and corresponding normally loaded (NL) controls in singly and socially housed female C57BL/6NJ mice.  ∗ NL social and HU social groups display statistically significant differences at indicated days at  p  < 0.05 using two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey  post hoc  test.

  "introduction": "Introduction The spaceflight environment poses significant challenges to multiple organ systems. Microgravity exposure leads to a cephalad fluid shift ( Foux et al., 1976 ;  Thornton et al., 1987 ) as well as osteopenia ( Lang et al., 2004 ) and sarcopenia ( LeBlanc et al., 2000 ). Spaceflight alters electrolyte balance ( Vorobiev et al., 1995 ) as well as endocrine ( Stowe et al., 2003 ,  2011 ), vision ( Zhang and Hargens, 2018 ) and baroreflex processes ( Fritsch et al., 1992 ;  Buckey et al., 1996 ;  Meck et al., 2001 ). Cardiovascular changes include stiffening of the carotid arteries as seen in astronauts returning from a 6-month ISS mission ( Hughson et al., 2016 ) and transient changes in heart rate variability ( Yamamoto et al., 2015 ). Spaceflight also may lead to CNS changes including a decline in cognitive performance ( Eddy et al., 1998 ). Immune system dysregulation also occurs, characterized by altered immune cell function and reactivation of viruses ( Crucian et al., 2015 ,  2018 ;  Mehta et al., 2017 ). These findings from astronauts are the main motivation to study rodents flown into space with the rationale that rodents are used extensively to model human conditions on Earth and may prove useful for understanding mechanisms and anticipating human responses to spaceflight. However, limited opportunities for rodent spaceflight studies, along with other challenges of conducting microgravity experiments, stimulated interest in using ground-based rodent models of weightlessness. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model was developed initially to simulate the responses of the musculoskeletal system to microgravity ( Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987 ;  Morey-Holton et al., 2005 ;  Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016 ). To date, its use has expanded to study the responses of other organ systems to spaceflight, including immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system ( Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016 ). The HU model also is utilized to study disorders on Earth such as osteopenia and sarcopenia because features of the HU model mimic bedrest and disuse.

  "discussion": "Discussion We have developed and validated a refinement to the NASA Ames HU model that accommodates paired housing of animals while retaining desirable features of the original design such as non-invasive attachment of the animal to the suspension harness and range of movement about the cage. An additional functionality to the current design includes individual access to food and water (not accessible to the other animal); thus, studies requiring customization of food or water as treatments can be readily conducted. Another feature of the current design includes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) materials, which can help achieve significant cost and time savings over the previous standard version ( Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002 ). These cage materials are compatible with typical cleaning and sterilization systems found in animal facilities. Finally, the cages occupy a smaller footprint since cage bottoms can be stacked for easy storage and improved transport. Overall, these changes to the design were intended to benefit investigators interested in conducting HU experiments. Other groups have reported the use of paired housing HU systems for mice ( Ferreira et al., 2011 ;  Lloyd et al., 2012 ;  Maurel et al., 2016 ). Similarities between the current design and a previously reported HU system ( Ferreira et al., 2011 ) include the use of COTS components, individual access to food and water and physical contact of cephalad regions of pair housed animals. Notable differences include the manner by which tail attachment to the suspension apparatus is achieved. In the model developed by  Ferreira et al. (2011) , the tail is secured to the suspension apparatus via piercing of the tail with surgical wire which may prove useful should there be concerns about tail necrosis and/or animals coming down from suspension. In our hands, however, we have not encountered tail necrosis nor accidental release from suspension in our HU studies of short or long duration (up to 30 days) using the tail traction approach. Thus our system has the advantage of avoiding the stress associated with anesthesia and tissue injury from surgical procedures. In addition, the current HU system includes the use of a floor grate and bedding that covers the entirety of the cage floor in contrast to the  Ferreira et al. (2011)  design where no floor grate was employed and bedding partially covered the cage bottom. The choice of flooring (grate, bedding or bare) can potentially impact experimental results. Hence, variations in flooring across current HU systems is one consideration in experiment design and when comparing across studies. Another difference includes the range of movement about the cage. Our current design retains the pulley apparatus of the standard NASA Ames HU system ( Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002 ), which generally allows for ambulation within most of the available cage area (close to half of the total cage area if socially housed). In contrast, the  Ferreira et ",
