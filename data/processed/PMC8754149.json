  "abstract": "ABSTRACT In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several  Sphingomonas  strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as  Sphingomonas sanguinis  ( n  = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as  Sphingomonas paucimobilis . Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23  Sphingomonas  species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for  S. sanguinis  in the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS  S. sanguinis  isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these  Sphingomonas  strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the  S. sanguinis  and  S. paucimobilis  strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related  S. sanguinis  and  S. paucimobilis  strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. IMPORTANCE \n Sphingomonas  is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the  Sphingomonas  genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of  Sphingomonas  members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future  in situ  studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS  Sphingomonas  isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.",

  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION Sphingomonas  species are found in a variety of habitats, including soil, marine sediments, wastewater, and freshwater, in addition to the habitats contaminated with dyes, herbicides, and other pollutants ( 1 – 3 ). They possess diverse catabolic capabilities; for instance, assimilation of different types of complex sugars, including polysaccharides, was reported ( 2 ). Some species are tolerant to copper, resulting in biofilm formation and eventually surface corrosion ( 4 ), and some aid in herbicide mineralization or degradation of pollutants ( 5 – 7 ).  Sphingomonas paucimobilis  has been isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) potable drinking water ( 8 ), ISS surfaces ( 9 ), and hospital clinical specimens and is known to cause rare infections in immunocompromised individuals ( 2 ,  10 ,  11 ). Recent reports have identified the role of some  Sphingomonas  species in plant growth promotion ( 5 ,  12 – 14 ). Microorganisms aid in plant growth promotion via different mechanisms, including secreting metabolites like phytohormones, solubilizing phosphate, fixating nitrogen, inducing stress response pathways, or acting as biocontrol agents ( 5 ,  14 – 19 ). Phytohormones play a significant role in plant metabolism and defense mechanisms ( 20 ). For instance, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is responsible for promoting cell division, elongation, and differentiation ( 21 ) and is involved in a wide range of plant processes ranging from responses to light and gravity to heavy metal stress tolerance ( 22 ,  23 ). Recent studies have detailed the role of  Sphingomonas  species in plant growth promotion via the production of phytohormones and increased stress tolerance.  S. paucimobilis  ZJSH1 produces phytohormones like IAA, salicylic acid, zeatin, and abscisic acid and helps in nitrogen fixation ( 14 ).  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11, isolated from the leaves of the arid medicinal plant  Tephrosia apollinea , was shown to produce auxins and gibberellins and was reported to increase stress tolerance to salinity and cadmium in tomato plants ( 12 ,  15 ,  24 ). In addition, genomic analysis of  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 also revealed genes for hydrogen peroxide production that enhance plant growth, seed germination, and root colonization, genes for phosphate uptake, osmotic stress, and heavy metal stress ( 15 ). Genomic analysis of  Sphingomonas panacis  DCY99 T  isolated from the roots of  Panax ginseng  identified genes for IAA production, phosphate solubilization, heavy metal stress tolerance, and degradation of phenolic compounds ( 5 ). Furthermore,  Sphingomonas  sp. Cra20 was shown to improve plant growth under drought stress conditions by altering the rhizosphere microbial community ( 13 ). The ability of microorganisms to produce phytohormones thus offers the potential to manipulate plant growth and development but without the need to supplement hormones externally to the plants. In an ongoing microbial tracking experiment on the ISS, several microbial strains belonging to  Sphingomonas sanguinis  ( n  = 2) were isolated from the ISS, and a third strain identified as  S. paucimobilis  was cultured from the Kennedy Space Center, Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF). After the isolation of  Sphingomonas  strains from the ISS ( 25 ,  26 ), a complete genome (∼4.4 Mbp) was also assembled from the shotgun reads retrieved from the same ISS environmental surface ( 26 ), resulting in the production of a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) belonging to  S. sanguinis . Given the persistence of  Sphingomonas  bacteria among spaceflight-relevant surfaces, and a growing body of evidence for  Sphingomonas  strains to promote plant growth, this study applies comparative genomic analyses to identify genetic determinants that relate to plant growth-promoting features (PGPF) and highlights those that may be adaptive to growth on spaceflight-relevant environments and surfaces. Our findings report the presence of several determinants for the production of plant phytohormones, including several gene products promoting resistance to sources of abiotic stress, with emphasis on oxidative/osmotic stress resistance, heavy metal tolerance, and adaptation to sources of radiation. Further, the production of a phytohormone, IAA, by these isolates was confirmed using metabolomics. Moreover, intersection analysis of functional annotations and orthologous groups from the  Sphingomonas  species from spaceflight-relevant surfaces (KSC-PHSF, ISS) revealed potential differences in gene contents involved in the horizontal gene transfer that are notably absent in their respective type strains. Taken together, our results show how characterization of microorganisms with respect to their ability to promote plant growth, including vegetables that can be used as a food source, will contribute to the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. RESULTS Abundance of  Sphingomonas  species in the ISS. Among the cultivable bacteria, three colonies obtained from ISS surfaces (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5) and one from KSC (FKI-L5-BR-P1) were identified as  Sphingomonas  species. All ISS strains were  S. sanguinis , and the KSC strain was  S. paucimobilis . The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and the draft genomes assembled were further used to confirm the identity of the species based on average nucleotide identity (ANI;  Table 1 ), which was calculated to be ∼99% with the nearest type strain. Genomic characteristics and other details of the annotation are given in  Table 1 . The metagenomic data analysis identified 23  Sphingomonas  species from flight 2, all of which were isolated from location 7, that is, a panel near the portable water dispenser (LAB) ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, the reads obtained from flight 1 belonging to a single species,  Sphingomonas \n sanxanigenens , were also seen in samples from flights 2 and 3 ( Fig. 1 ). However, its location on the ISS varied across different flights. Reads obtained from flight 3 also showed the presence of  S. paucimobilis  from location 4, that is, the dining table (node 1). The metagenomic reads thus obtained from the ISS show that  Sphingomonas  species persisted across all three flights, with  S. sanguinis  being abundant among all  Sphingomonas  species in flight 2. Furthermore, the MAG sequence (ISS-IIF7SWP) exhibited >99.6% ANI with the type strain of  S. sanguinis  ( Table 1 ). The MAG was derived from the exact location on the ISS where  S. sanguinis  isolates IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5 were retrieved using cultivation techniques. It was also confirmed that the MAG genome had >99% ANI value with the genomes of the  S. sanguinis  strains isolated from the ISS. The use of the culture-dependent and -independent methods thus confirms the presence of  S. sanguinis  on the ISS.

The numbers on top of bars represent the number of  Sphingomonas  species identified from that particular location in the corresponding flight number (F1, F2, or F3). Different locations on the ISS from where samples were collected: location 1, port panel next to cupola (node 3); location 2, waste and hygiene compartment (node 3); location 3, advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) foot platform (node 3); location 4, dining table (node 1); location 5, zero G stowage rack (node 1); location 7, panel near portable water dispenser (LAB); and location 8, port crew quarters, bump out exterior aft wall (node 2).

Plant growth-promoting features in  Sphingomonas  species isolated from spaceflight environments. BLAST-based genome comparisons visualized using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across each spaceflight genome and their type strains compared against the  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 genome ( Fig. 2 ). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each  S. sanguinis  (66.1 to 66.2%) and  S. paucimobilis  (65.5%) genome were highly similar to that of LK11 (66.09%). Subsequent pangenome comparisons conducted by Anvi’o revealed a substantial core genome and further support both shared nucleotide and functional identity among these spaceflight  Sphingomonas  genomes, their type strains, and the endophyte  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 ( Fig. 3 ). FIG 2 Circular genome representations were constructed using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) version 0.95, with  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 selected as the reference genome (chromosome and plasmids). The innermost ring (black) shows the GC content of the reference  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 genome. Subsequent rings illustrate the percent identity of the selected  Sphingomonas  genomes calculated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%, upper identity cutoff: 90%). Starting from ring two, the order of the illustrated genomes is as follows: 2,  S. paucimobilis  FKI-L5-BR-P1; 3,  S. paucimobilis  LCT-SP1; 4,  S. paucimobilis  NCTC 11030 T ; 5,  S. sanguinis  IIF7SW-B3A; 6,  S. sanguinis  IIF7SW-B5; 7,  S. sanguinis  ISS-IIF7SWP (MAG); 8,  S. sanguinis  NBRC 13937 T . The outermost ring displays randomly selected annotations originating from the  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 chromosome. FIG 3 Pangenome analysis of  S. sanguinis ,  S. paucimobilis  genomes obtained from space-relevant surfaces with their type strains, and  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11, generated by the Anvi’o software. Primary functional annotation in Anvi’o was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command (–num-threads 2, –mcl-inflation 6, –min-bit 0.5, –use-ncbi-blast). Ordering of the pangenome display was determined using a Euclidean distance clustering algorithm and the provided ward linkage method. Beginning from the innermost ring and moving outward, rings 1 to 8 correspond to gene clusters identified in each of the analyzed  Sphingomonas  genomes in the following order: 1,  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11; 2,  S. paucimobilis  FKI-L5-BR-P1; 3,  Sphingomonas  LCT-SP1; 4,  S. paucimobilis  NCTC 11030 T ; 5,  S. sanguinis  IIF7SW-B3A; 6,  S. sanguinis  IIF7SW-B5; 7,  S. sanguinis  ISS-IIF7SWP (MAG); 8,  S. sanguinis  NBRC 13937 T . Ring 9 shows a density plot of the number of genes within the identified gene clusters, and ring 10 highlights single-copy gene clusters (black). Rings 11 and 12 correspond to the geometric homogeneity index and functional homogeneity indices of similarity, with the former accounting for gaps in alignments, while the latter scores functional similarities by residue within the aligned sequences. The outermost ring represents the location of known Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) functional categories. The right-most bar chart corresponds to the number of singleton gene clusters, number of gene clusters, number of genes, total length, and GC content for each genome present in the analysis. Due to the high degree of functional identity shared between each of the space  Sphingomonas  species and  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11, functional annotations for each of the spaceflight  Sphingomonas  genomes and their type strains were conducted to identify putative PGPF. Functional analysis of these outputs revealed that many PGPFs proposed for  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 ( 15 ) are likely also present in the analyzed  S. sanguinis  and  S. paucimobilis  genomes. Annotations reported from the EggNOGv5 database suggest that several gene products proposed to promote phosphate and sulfur assimilation in plants are also present in these select  Sphingomonas  strains, albeit with some species-specific patterns. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake metabolism and solubilization in soil appear to be conserved across all the selected  S. paucimobilis  and  S. sanguinis  strains; however, gene products associated with sulfate/thiosulfate and hydrogen production may be exclusive to the selected  S. sanguinis  strains. Furthermore, several pathways proposed to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including the heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be shared between these selected  S. sanguinis  and  S. paucimobilis  genomes. Previous reports suggested that responses to oxidative stress in  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 may promote plant host tolerance to abiotic stress via the amelioration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( 12 ,  15 ,  27 ). Therefore, specific gene products related to oxidative stress resistance in space-associated  Sphingomonas  strains were further identified. Analysis of annotations generated by PGAP and eggNOG-MapperV2 suggested that space-associated  Sphingomonas  strains harbor multiple copies of several classes of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases, and glutaredoxins. Next, we sought to identify metabolic pathways suggested to reduce the abundance of ROS, for instance, carotenoids, which are known for their antioxidant activity ( 28 ). Examination of PGAP and eggNOG annotations suggest that all  Sphingomonas  strains analyzed in this study possess the genetic repertoire ( crtB ,  crtI ,  crtY ,  crtZ ) to produce the carotenoid zeaxanthin from the precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) ( Fig. 4A ). Further analysis also revealed the presence of an unnamed sterol desaturase family protein, often proximate to these gene clusters, which shared high identity to the  crtG  gene product identified in  Sphingomonas elodea  ATCC 31461 (74% to 75% identity) ( 29 ).  CrtG  converts zeaxanthin to produce the yellow pigment nostoxanthin, a common carotenoid produced by  Sphingomonas  ( 30 ). Likewise, two pathways for the production of the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose were also identified in both the  S. sanguinis  and  S. paucimobilis  strains. Trehalose serves a variety of functions across organisms, acting as a carbon source, a compatible solute, and a metabolite that provides protection against a variety of abiotic stressors ( 31 ). These results suggest that  Sphingomonas  strains can potentially synthesize trehalose from the  otsA/B  pathway, wherein a two-step mechanism catalyzes the formation of trehalose 6-phosphate from the condensation of glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose residues ( otsA ) and subsequent dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate into the disaccharide trehalose ( otsB ). Additionally, trehalose could also be produced in these bacteria through catabolism of α(1,4) glucose polymers into trehalose via the  treY/Z  pathway ( Fig. 4B ). FIG 4 (A) Zeaxanthin and nostoxanthin pathway. (B) Genes discussed relevant to trehalose metabolism in  S. sanguinis  and  S. paucimobilis . In the first step of the  otsA/B  pathway, a condensation reaction between glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose synthesizes trehalose 6-phosphate ( otsA ). Second, a dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate catalyzed by  otsB  yields the product trehalose. Additionally, trehalose can also be formed from the rearrangement of the α(1,4) glycosidic bonds of glucose polymers to α(1) glycosidic bonds via  treY , allowing for the hydrolysis of the terminal trehalose disaccharide via  treZ . (C) Proposed pathway for IAA production in  S. paucimobilis  and  S. sanguinis  using functional predictions generated by eggNOG-MapperV2. Enzyme classes are denoted in brackets, with gene, enzyme, or protein names provided where appropriate. Purple coloring denotes identified enzyme classes that were identified only in the analyzed  S. paucimobilis  spaceflight strains. Question marks (??) denote yet-to-be-validated reaction mechanisms in the proposed pathway. Chemical structures were constructed using the ChemDraw software. These findings suggest that the tested  Sphingomonas  species, including the strains sequenced from spaceflight-relevant surfaces, contain several pathways likely to confer resistance to a variety of abiotic stressors, especially with respect to several antioxidant enzymes and metabolites. The presence of these features supports the potential role of these newly sequenced  Sphingomonas  strains to promote plant growth and increase plant stress tolerance. Indole-3-acetic acid production by  S. sanguinis  and  S. paucimobilis  strains isolated from the ISS. One of the sources of IAA biosynthesis is the amino acid tryptophan, and analysis of the orthologous groups identified by the eggNOGv5 database suggested that the selected  Sphingomonas  strains possess the required tryptophan biosynthesis genes ( trpA , B , C , D , E , F ), consistent with observations from previous reports in the literature ( 5 ,  15 ). Leveraging the inclusion of several KEGG orthologs, enzyme classes, and KEGG reactions outputs via eggNOG-MapperV2, potential pathways for these  Sphingomonas  to synthesize IAA from tryptophan are proposed ( Fig. 4C ). Analysis of the functional annotations transferred from the EggNOGv5 database pointed to a group of carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family proteins that may act as putative nitrilases (E.C 3.5.5.1), converting indole-3-acetonitrile directly to IAA. Similarly, each of the analyzed  Sphingomonas  strains harbors a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase (putative monoamine oxidase EC 1.4.3.4), which likely promotes the conversion of tryptamine into indole-3-acetaldehyde. However, subsequent steps allowing the conversion of indole-3-acetaldehyde to IAA via an unnamed aldehyde dehydrogenase family protein (EC 1.2.1.3) were exclusive to the analyzed  S. paucimobilis  genomes. Further, the presence of indole-pyruvate ferredoxin, an enzyme which is responsible for the conversion of indole-3-pyruvate into S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), was also exclusive to  S. paucimobilis ; however, it is unclear as to how  S. paucimobilis  may further alter S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl-CoA into IAA. While two putative mechanisms across both  S. sanguinis  and  S. paucimobilis  that may directly yield IAA from tryptophan-derived metabolites are supported by the results of functional annotation, we failed to identify canonical mechanisms for the formation of the upstream reactants in tryptophan metabolism, suggesting that novel mechanisms for IAA formation may occur in  Sphingomonas  and species-dependent pathways may supplement a shared metabolic pathway. Interestingly, while an auxin export carrier family protein was identified in each of the analyzed  S. paucimobilis  genomes, no such protein was identified in  S. sanguinis . Since the genomic analysis of the spaceflight isolates revealed genetic signatures for the production of several plant growth-promoting hormones, me",

  "discussion": "DISCUSSION This study shows the identification of putative PGPFs in  Sphingomonas  strains isolated from the ISS or in a cleanroom where spacecraft are assembled. The features involved in the plant growth promotion were identified based on comparative genomic analysis with a well-characterized endophyte  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11. Such comparative genomic analysis of the  S. sanguinis  IIF7SW-B3A,  S. sanguinis  IIF7SW-B5,  S. sanguinis  ISS-IIF7SWP, and  S. paucimobilis  FKI-L5-BR-P1 spaceflight genomes, along with their respective type strains, showed substantial genomic similarity to  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11, evidenced by high nucleotide identity and a large core genome shared among these bacteria. Leveraging extensive annotation provided by the eggNOG-MapperV2 software, PGPFs described previously for  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 ( 14 ) were largely consistent with the results of comparative analysis conducted in this study. While minor species-specific differences in sulfur assimilation and hydrogen sulfide production were identified in  S. sanguinis , all genomes shared similar putative PGPFs. Specifically, genomic analysis highlighted the presence of several enzyme classes that participate in ROS metabolism which appear to be present in multiple copies across each of the selected  Sphingomonas  genomes. In addition, analysis of metabolic pathways of spaceflight  Sphingomonas  strains also suggested that each strain is likely capable of producing the carotenoids zeaxanthin and nostoxanthin. Zeaxanthin has been suggested to play a number of roles in both bacteria and plants, including photoprotection, detoxification of ROS, and resistance to ionizing radiation ( 32 ). Indeed, high levels of zeaxanthin production in the bacterium  Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens  were shown to promote resistance to ionizing, UV radiation, and hydrogen peroxide; however, resistance among the select  Sphingomonas  strains was weaker than that among  P. zeaxanthinifaciens  ( 33 ). Additionally, zeaxanthin also serves as a metabolic precursor for the formation of the plant phytohormone abscisic acid, prompting speculation that zeaxanthin-producing, plant-associated microbes may promote plant growth by supplying plant hosts with carotenoid derivatives such as zeaxanthin ( 34 ). Further evidence for producing plant-relevant metabolites that confer antioxidant activity was also supported by the identification of the  otsA/B  and  treY/Z  pathways in each of the spaceflight  Sphingomonas  strains, strongly suggesting that these bacteria produce the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose. These results are in agreement with the identification of the  otsA/B  and  treY/Z  pathways in  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11 ( 15 ), as well as with previous work demonstrating that soybean plants inoculated with  Sphingomonas  sp. LK11, with and without exogenous trehalose, improved plant growth and stress tolerance under drought stress conditions induced via polyethylene glycol treatment ( 27 ). Likewi",
  "conclusion": "Conclusions. This study utilized comparative genomics and identified a plethora of factors in  Sphingomonas  present in spaceflight environments that may result in the production of several PGPFs and aid in the growth of plants. The production of one of the phytohormones IAA was also confirmed using metabolomics. These space  Sphingomonas  strains, along with other plant growth-promoting strains of microbes isolated from the ISS ( 62 ), therefore, hold great potential to contribute to space exploration through promoting and controlling plant growth as part of an integrated bio-regenerative life support system enabling future extended-duration crewed missions."
