  "abstract": "Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Mice are among the most commonly utilized animal models for aging-related metabolic bone disease in humans. Advantages of mice over many models include their small size, relatively short lifespan, and ease of genetic manipulation. However, differences in physiology between the two species may preclude the direct translation of experimental results from mice to humans ( 1 ,  2 ). Although aging-related bone loss occurs in both mice and humans, the temporal pattern of bone loss between the species is markedly different, at least in long bones, raising concern that the underlying mechanisms for the bone loss may differ. In mice, cancellous bone loss in long bones occurs prior to skeletal maturity (6 months of age) and concurrently with bone elongation and cortical bone accrual ( 3 ,  4 ). Therefore, by the time mice reach skeletal maturity, defined as cessation of linear bone growth, a large portion of their cancellous bone has been resorbed, and little cancellous bone is available to effectively model aging-related skeletal impairment. This pattern of bone loss is not evident in all small rodents. Cancellous bone loss in rats occurs later in life ( 5 ). In humans, cancellous bone loss occurs long after skeletal maturity, primarily due to negative remodeling balance, where the rate of bone resorption exceeds the rate of formation ( 6 ). The mechanism(s) mediating premature cancellous bone loss in mice have not been extensively investigated, but our previous work suggests that the ambient temperature of standard rodent housing (18–23°C) plays an important role ( 2 ). We previously reported that housing C57BL/6J (B6) female mice at a thermoneutral temperature (32°C) prevented cancellous bone loss from 8 to 18 weeks of age, an interval during which the mice accrued cortical bone. Compared to standard room temperature housing (22°C), mice housed at thermoneutral conditions had increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption ( 2 ). Differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms between mice and humans may be a critical aspect in understanding species-specific skeletal maturation and aging-related bone loss. Humans are homeotherms and maintain their body temperature within a narrow range ( 7 ). In contrast, mice are facultative daily heterotherms and experience fasting-induced decreases in body temperature upon exposure to temperatures below their thermoneutral zone (26–34°C) ( 8 ). During the light photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are reduced, laboratory mice, depending on housing conditions (e.g., temperature, bedding material, number of animals/cage), can undergo intermittent bouts of torpor, which is driven by fasting-induced reduction in serum leptin and characterized by a metabolic rate below basal metabolic level and decreased core body temperature ( 2 ,  8 ). Conversely, when food intake and locomotor activity are increased during the dark photoperiod, mice utilize energy-requiring adaptive thermogenesis to help maintain sufficient core body temperature, resulting in a net increase in food consumption. Non-shivering thermogenesis, a form of adaptive thermogenesis, is particularly important for adaptation to a cold environment and is regulated by neuroendocrine mechanisms that induce sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to brown adipose tissue (BAT), where heat is generated through the uncoupling of oxidation and phosphorylation by uncoupling proteins (UCPs) ( 9 ). Bone is highly innervated by efferent sympathetic neurons ( 10 ,  11 ), and catecholaminergic activity modulates the function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and may play a role in mediating premature bone loss in mice ( 12 ,  13 ). Hormones can directly influence bone health, and sex steroids, in particular, are known modulators of bone metabolism ( 14 ). Consequently, female and male mice exhibit sexually dimorphic trajectories of skeletal growth and changes in morphology throughout the lifespan ( 4 ). While premature cancellous bone loss occurs in male mice, bone loss appears to occur later than that in females ( 4 ). Therefore, in this study we sought to determine if our prior results regarding the effects of housing temperature on bone in female B6 mice were generalizable to male B6 mice. Determining the causes of premature bone loss in mice, and whether this occurs in a sexually dimorphic manner, will contribute to optimization of experimental models more closely matching human physiology and provide novel information on potential factors contributing to aging-related bone loss. Materials and methods Experimental design Five-week-old male B6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and housed under controlled conditions with approval of the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were individually housed in a room on standard light cycle (12 h light; 12 h dark), and food and water were provided  ad libitum . Body weight and food consumption were monitored weekly for the duration of the study. Mice were randomized into two housing conditions, a room temperature of 22°C (standard vivarium room temperature,  n  = 9) or a room temperature of 32°C (thermoneutral temperature for mice,  n  = 9), and maintained at their respective temperatures from 5 (rapidly growing) until 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Male B6 mice reach peak cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis at ~8 weeks of age and peak cortical and total femur bone volume by 6 months of age ( 4 ). The mice were injected with the fluorochrome calcein (15 mg/kg, Sigma) 4 days and 1 day prior to killing to label bone surfaces undergoing mineralization. For tissue collection, mice were deeply anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and bled by decapitation. Blood glucose was measured using a glucometer (OneTouch Ultra Mini, LifeScan, Milpitas, CA, USA). Serum was collected and stored at −80°C for analyses of markers of bone turnover and leptin. Abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) was removed and weighed. Right femora and the fifth lumbar vertebrae were isolated, fixed for 24 h in 10% formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for microcomputed tomography and histomorphometric analyses. Left tibiae were removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C for gas chromatographic analysis of lipid species. Interscapular BAT was removed and stored in RNALater (ThermoFisher) at −80°C for RNA analysis of  Ucp1 . A second cohort of mice ( n  = 10) was killed at 8 weeks of age as an asynchronous baseline control group. Chemistry Serum leptin was measured using Mouse Leptin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems), serum osteocalcin was measured using Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), and serum CTX-1 was measured using Mouse CTX-1 ELISA kit (Life Sciences Advanced Technologies, St. Petersburg, FL, USA) according to the respective manufacturer’s protocol. Microcomputed tomography Microcomputed tomography (μCT) was used for nondestructive 3D evaluation of bone volume and architecture in femur and fifth lumbar vertebra as previously described ( 2 ). Histomorphometry Methods used here for measuring static and dynamic bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis have been described in detail ( 2 ,  15 ,  16 ). Whole tibia lipid analysis Frozen tibiae were homogenized in 40% methanol, and total lipids extracted from the bone using methanol-chloroform (1:2 ratio) with butylated hydroxytolulene (1 µM); 10-nonadecenoic acid 19:1 (Δ10 cis) (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, MN, USA) was added as a recovery standard at the time of extraction. Total lipids were saponified, and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared and analyzed by gas chromatography using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector ( 17 ). Methylated fatty acid standards were obtained from Nu-Chek Prep. Gene expression Frozen BAT was homogenized in TRIzol and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was generated using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR. BAT  Ucp1  gene expression was assessed using the primer sequences: forward GTGAAGGTCAGAATGCAAGC and reverse AGGGCCCCCTTCATGAGGTC. Relative  Ucp1  transcript abundance was normalized using 18S ribosomal RNA using the primer sequences: forward CCGCAGCTAGGAATAATGGAAT and reverse CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT. Statistics Mean responses of individual variables were compared for 8-week-old mice housed at 22°C and 16-week-old mice housed at either 22°C or 32°C using one-way ANOVA, with  t -tests used to make pairwise comparisons. The Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. Histomorphometric parameters measured in mice housed at 22°C or 32°C were compared using  t -tests or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests. Longitudinal data on body mass and food intake were modeled using a general linear model with a compound symmetric correlation matrix and a binary fixed effect for treatment group (control temperature 22°C or thermoneutral temperature 32°C). A constant time trend was used for food intake and a linear time trend was used for body mass. A two-factor ANOVA with an interaction between sex (male and female) and age (8-week-old mice and 16–18 week old mice) was used to compare mean values for architectural endpoints between male (current study) and female (published data) ( 2 ) B6 mice housed at 22°C. In addition, a two-way ANOVA was used to investigate for effect modification between temperature and sex (i.e., whether the magnitude of the effect of temperature was the same for male and female mice). The required conditions for valid use of Gaussian linear models were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson–Darling test of normality. The Benjamini and Hochberg method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons ( 18 ). Data analysis was performed using R version 3.4.3. Results Compared to baseline, male B6 mice housed at 22°C accrued bone as evidenced by gains in femur length ( Fig. 1A ) and midshaft femur cortical thickness ( Fig. 1C ). These growth-related gains in bone length and cortical bone, however, were contrasted by a reduction in cancellous bone volume fraction ( Fig. 1D ) and connectivity density ( Fig. 1E ) in the distal femur metaphysis. The reduction in cancellous bone and increased trabecular spacing ( Fig. 1G ) was primarily due to decreased trabecular number ( Fig. 1F ) as trabecular thickness ( Fig. 1H ) was not changed.

There was no impact of aging or housing temperature on trabecular thickness ( Fig. 1H ). The impact of housing temperature on cortical bone in the femur diaphysis and cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis can be visually observed in  Fig. 1N . In the distal femur epiphysis, cancellous bone volume fraction was not influenced by aging or housing temperature ( Fig. 1I ), but aging, independent of housing temperature led to changes in microarchitecture. Specifically, aging resulted in decreased connectivity density and trabecular number ( Fig. 1J  and  K ) and increased trabecular spacing ( Fig. 1L ). Distal femur epiphysis trabecular thickness ( Fig. 1M ) was not altered by aging or housing temperature. Representative microCT images of the femur epiphysis are shown in  Fig. 1N . Housing mice at 22°C reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the 5th lumbar vertebra ( Fig. 2A ), which was co-incidental with reductions in connectivity density ( Fig. 2B ) trabecular number ( Fig. 2C ), trabecular thickness ( Fig. 2E ), and an increase in trabecular spacing ( Fig. 2D ). Housing mice at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) protected against reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness and increased spacing, and attenuated aging-related reductions in trabecular number and connectivity density ( Fig. 2A ,  B ,  C  and  D ). The impact of housing temperature on cancellous bone in the fifth lumbar vertebra can be visually observed in  Fig. 2F .

Osteoblast perimeter ( Fig. 3A ), mineralizing perimeter ( Fig. 3B ), and bone formation rate normalized to bone perimeter ( Fig. 3D ), bone area ( Fig. 3E ), and tissue area ( Fig. 3F ) were all higher in mice housed at 32°C compared to mice housed at 22°C. Mineral apposition rate, an index of osteoblast activity, was not altered by housing temperature ( Fig. 3C ), indicating that the higher cancellous bone volume fraction in mice housed at 32°C was due, in part, to higher osteoblast number rather than higher intrinsic osteoblast activity. These cellular markers of bone formation were co-incidental with higher serum osteocalcin, a systemic marker of bone formation ( Fig. 3G ). Mice housed at 32°C exhibited no change in osteoclast perimeter ( Fig. 3H ), a measure of local bone resorption, but did exhibit lower levels of serum CTX-1, a marker of global bone resorption ( Fig. 3I ). The impact of housing temperature on bone formation in the distal femur metaphysis can be visually observed in  Fig. 3J . Figure 3 Indices of bone formation consisting of osteoblast perimeter (A), mineralizing perimeter (B), mineral apposition rate (C), bone formation rate/bone perimeter (D), bone formation rate/bone area (E), bone formation rate/tissue area (F), serum osteocalcin, and indices of bone resorption consisting of osteoclast perimeter (H) and serum CTX-1 in male B6 mice maintained at 22°C and 32°C from 5 to 16 weeks of age.

Fasting blood glucose ( Fig. 4E ) was unchanged and circulating leptin levels ( Fig. 4F ) were higher in thermoneutral-housed mice. Housing temperature-associated changes in adiposity did not extend to the bone marrow compartment as we observed no between-group differences in marrow adipocyte area/tissue area, adipocyte number or size as assessed by histomorphometry ( Fig. 4G ,  H  and  I ), or whole tibia fatty acids as assessed by gas chromatography ( Fig. 4J  and  K ).

The effects of sex (female and male), age (8 week old and 16-18 week old), and their interaction on femur length, total femur bone volume, cortical thickness in femur diaphysis, and cancellous bone volume fraction, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness in distal femur metaphysis are shown in  Table 1 . Femur length was greater in males compared to females and greater in older compared to younger animals. Cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness were likewise greater in males than females. Cancellous bone volume fraction decreased with age, irrespective of sex; the decrease was not associated with a decrease in trabecular thickness. Whereas significant sex by age interactions were not detected for any of the aforementioned endpoints, interactions were noted for total femur bone volume, cortical thickness in diaphysis, and trabecular number in distal femur metaphysis. Total femur bone volume differed between females and males at baseline and study termination, but the difference was more pronounced at the earlier age. Whereas males exhibited greater cortical thickness than females at 8 weeks of age, this difference was no longer evident at study termination. Trabecular number in the femoral metaphysis was higher in males than females at both ages, but the magnitude of difference was greater in the older animals. There was a tendency ( P  = 0.076) for total femur bone volume to increase with age in females but not in males. Cortical thickness increased with age in both females and males but the magnitude of increase was greater in females. Trabecular number in distal femur metaphysis decreased with age in both females and males, but the decrease was greater in females.\n Table 1 The independent and combined effects of sex and age on femur in mice housed at 22°C.

  "discussion": "Discussion Housing male B6 mice at thermoneutral temperature, compared to standard room temperature, attenuates premature cancellous bone loss; mice housed at 22°C from 5 to 16 weeks of age exhibited reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra compared to baseline, while mice housed at 32°C exhibited complete maintenance of the bone volume fraction. At the cellular level, the protective effects of 32°C housing temperature were associated with a net increase in bone formation. The physiological mechanisms through which housing temperature influences bone metabolism and homeostasis in mice have not been established, but based on precedent ( 19 ) likely involve neuroendocrine pathways related to activation of adaptive thermogenesis, particularly non-shivering thermogenesis. As noted in the Introduction, mice are facultative daily heterotherms and experience fasting-induced reductions in body temperature when subjected to housing temperatures below their thermoneutral zones ( 20 ). In response to cold stress, sympathetic nervous system activation and catecholaminergic signaling induce non-shivering thermogenesis via upregulation of UCPs in BAT, which generates heat through proton leakage across the inner mitochondrial membrane ( 9 ). Housing mice at thermoneutral temperature alleviates the need for adaptive thermogenesis and decreases sympathetic nervous system activity compared to room temperature housing ( 21 ). In the present study, we found housing mice at 32°C reduced adaptive thermogenesis and presumably sympathetic nervous system activity, as evidenced by a significant downregulation of BAT  Ucp1  gene expression and protected mice from premature cancellous bone loss. Bone, particularly periosteum ( 13 ), is highly innervated by efferent sympathetic nerves and it is well documented that catecholaminergic signaling pathways in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells modulate the functional activity and differentiation fate of these cells; in general, increased catecholaminergic activity inhibits osteoblast function and enhances osteoclast function ( 22 ). However,  in vivo  studies demonstrate the complexity of regulation. The embryological origin of the bone (endochondral versus membranous), the distribution and phenotype of nerve fibers, and the relative impact of α- and β-adrenergic receptor signaling may influence the skeletal response to housing temperature ( 23 ). Additionally, alternative mechanisms, including reduced glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone and increased leptin levels, cannot be overlooked as potential mediators of housing temperature’s impact on bone. These hormones regulate bone metabolism and their levels are altered by housing temperature ( 24 ,  25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31 ). Bone mass is determined by the balance of bone formation and bone resorption, and the findings herein suggest the bone-protective effects of 32°C housing on cancellous bone volu",
