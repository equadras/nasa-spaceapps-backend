  "abstract": "We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure. Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll  a  = 7.6 μgL -1 , turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll  a  = 25.0 μgL -1 , turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L −1 . The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as  Ochromonas  sp. and  Chlamydomonas  sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.",

Currently, glyphosate-based herbicides, whose main mode of action is through the disruption of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis ( Amrhein et al., 1980 ), are used worldwide, while other herbicides are applied as complementary tools for weed control. Herbicides have several different modes of action ( Peterson et al., 2015 ). Auxinic herbicides, which belong to a chemical family largely used in agriculture, mimic the biphasic effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which is the principal natural auxin in higher plants. It usually stimulates growth by cell division and elongation when targeted to cell sites of action at low concentration ( Grossmann, 2010 ). Auxin-derived herbicides such as phenoxy hormone products were used in an average of 22,916 tons worldwide between 1990-2002. The use of these herbicides was reported to increase an average of 30,436 tons of active ingredients between 2003-2014 ( FAOSTAT, 2018 ). After more than 2 decades of glyphosate massive spraying in Argentina, the use of herbicides such as 2,4-D, paraquat and dicamba has sky-rocketed in the last years to prevent the spread of glyphosate resistance in target weeds. The 2,4-D was the third most imported herbicide into Argentina between 2013 and 2015 ( SENASA, 2018 ), and now it is considered one of the most used agrochemicals worldwide ( Singh and Singh, 2016 ). Moreover, plants genetically modified to tolerate different herbicides, including 2,4-D, were recently approved for commercial production in Argentina ( CONABIA, 2019 ). Under this scenario, 2,4-D application rates are expected to increase in Argentina. The 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is an auxin-type selective herbicide that induces overgrowth of vascular cambium in dicotyledonous, ultimately leading to death ( Song, 2014 ). After application, it is transformed by bacterial metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle ( Singh and Singh, 2016 ). The persistence of 2,4-D in the environment depends on the availability of other carbon sources involved in microbial metabolism, its half-life being between 20 and 312 days ( Islam et al., 2018 ). Build-up of 2,4-D residues may cause important alterations in soil and aquatic ecosystems. The 2,4-D can produce disruptive effects in fungi ( Bernat et al., 2018 ), insects ( Sharma et al., 2018 ), amphibians ( LaChapelle et al., 2007 ;  Aronzon et al., 2011 ;  Van Meter et al., 2018 ), fish ( Dehnert et al., 2018 ;  De Arcaute et al., 2018 ), and others (Islam et a. 2018). Other studies reported the effect of pure 2,4-D on microbial communities ( Kobraei and White, 1996 ;  Aguayo et al., 2014 ;  Lozano et al., 2018 ), but little is known about the collateral impact of commercial formulations of this herbicide on wild biota in agricultural landscapes. These commercial formulations consist of the active ingredient (2,4-D), water and inert elements such as solvents, surfactants and humectants of unknown composition which increase plant cuticle permeability to 2,4-D ( Lanctôt et al., 2014 ). The 2,4-D has different effects according to its concentration: low concentrations stimulate the growth of some phytoplanktonic species, whereas high concentrations inhibit their development ( Boyle, 1980 ;  Kobraei and White, 1996 ;  Wong, 2000 ). In regard to other freshwater communities,  De Lipthay et al. (2003)  reported that low concentrations of the active ingredient (a.i.) (<40 μg L −1 ) modify the structure of the bacterial community from a shallow aquifer, leading to an increase in 2,4-D degrading bacteria. In addition, an increase in Actinobacteria growth was detected at 20 mg L −1  of 2,4-D in an oligotrophic lake ( Aguayo et al., 2014 ), which resulted from the ability of  Arthrobacter  sp. to use 2,4-D and other aromatic compounds as sources of carbon and energy ( Sandmann and Loos, 1988 ;  Westerberg et al., 2000 ). It is well known that freshwater systems become contaminated either by direct spraying over water or indirectly via soil drift ( Ensminger et al., 2013 ;  Aparicio et al., 2015 ;  Berman et al., 2018 ;  Metcalfe et al., 2019 ). Algae and cyanobacteria from lakes, ponds and rivers share several metabolic pathways with vascular plants, suggesting that they can be similarly affected by herbicides ( Ferrari et al., 2018 ). Indeed, these organisms have shown to be severely altered, mainly at the population level ( Vera et al., 2010 ,  2012 ;  Lipok et al., 2010 ;  Pérez et al., 2011 ;  Qiu et al., 2013 ;  Pizarro et al., 2016 ). They are important in freshwater ecosystems because of their role as main primary producers, either as free-living planktonic organisms or attached to diverse substrata (phyto-periphyton fraction). Taking into account the important ecosystem services supplied by freshwater systems, there is increasing concern about the deleterious effect of herbicides, as previously demonstrated for glyphosate ( Pérez et al., 2007 ). There are more than 10,000 shallow lakes in the Pampa plain of Argentina ( Dukatz et al., 2006 ), which is one of the most affected regions by agricultural activities worldwide. These water bodies switch between two alternative stable states with contrasting typologies ( Scheffer et al., 1993 ): clear-water lakes with very low phytoplankton abundance and turbid ones dominated by phytoplankton. Both states show different phytoplankton populations, as they are adapted to distinct nutrient and light conditions ( Allende et al., 2009 ). In last decades, however, there are some evidences indicating that lakes remain turbid due to agrochemical contamination ( Quirós et al., 2002 ;  Vera et al., 2010 ). In this work we evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D, on the structure of freshwater microbial communities under different exposure conditions using microcosms. The assays were carried out with two different consolidated microbial assemblages. One of these was sampled from a clear freshwater system and the other from a turbid freshwater system. We analyzed the quali- and quantitative composition of micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm) and photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which includes prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk). Bacterioplankton (HB, heterotrophic bacteria) was also considered in the analysis}. All the microbial communities were exposed to a wide range of concentrations of the active ingredient for 7 d. We tested the following hypotheses: 1- the impact of AsiMax 50® depends on water turbidity, which results from the different structure of the microbial communities; and 2- the impact of AsiMax 50® depends on the 2,4-D concentration used. 2 Methods We performed a manipulative laboratory experiment with 48 microcosms, each of which consisted of a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask filled with water (experimental unit = e.u.), taken from two outdoor water systems of contrasting turbidity status. Of these, 24 were filled with clear water (thereafter referred to as clear) and 24 with organic turbid water (thereafter referred to as turbid). The initial conditions of water samples were: chlorophyll  a  = 7.6 μg L −1 , turbidity = 1 NTU for clear and chlorophyll  a  = 25.0 μg L −1 , turbidity = 9 NTU for turbid. These environmental variables are usually used to characterize the shallow lakes typical of the Pampa plain from Argentina ( Allende et al., 2009 ). Microcosms were randomly placed in a shaking chamber set at 25 °C and 12:12 L:D photoperiod during the entire exposure to AsiMax 50®. After a microcosm stabilization period of 3 days, the experiment started with the addition of 2,4-D as commercial formulation of AsiMax 50®, randomly applied in triplicate, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i. L −1  to clear and turbid microcosms. The sampling scheme was as follows: a) samples were taken from 3 e.u. at zero time (T0, before addition of AsiMax 50®) to determine the initial conditions of physical and chemical parameters and micro + nanophytoplankton; b) samples were taken from all treatments after 7d (Tf, final time) to determine treatment effect; c) considering the time scale at which populations of very small organisms react to an impact ( Peck, 2011 ), samples of PPP and HB were taken after 15 min (T1) and 7 d (Tf) of 2,4-D addition (n = 24 for both groups). 2.1 Physical and chemical parameters The real concentrations of 2,4-D were measured from water samples collected from all the e.u. and kept at -20 °C for further processing. For 2,4-D determination, samples were unfrozen, homogenized and diluted 1:10 with Milli-Q water. Finally, the samples were collected in 2-mL glass vials and the analysis was performed using HPLC-UV technique coupled with UV detector at 232 nm ( APHA, 2005 ). Turbidity was measured with a portable turbidimeter (Hach® 2100 P). 2.2 Biological variables 2.2.1 Chlorophyll a concentration For chlorophyll  a  determination, 200-mL water samples were filtered through Whatman® GF/F filters and stored at -20 °C. Chlorophyll  a  concentration values were obtained by spectrophotometric absorbance, using acetone as solvent. Absorbances were read at 665 and 750 nm, before and after acidification with HCl 1 N. Before reading, samples were first left overnight in the solvent and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm. Concentration values were obtained following  Lilchtenthaler and Wellburn (1983) . 2.2.2 Micro and nano-phytoplankton (2–200 μm) A 200-mL water sample from each e.u. was fixed with acidified Lugol's iodine solution and kept at 4 °C for subsequent phytoplankton (˃2 μm) counts. These were made according to Utermöhl's technique ( Utermöhl, 1958 ) to the lowest taxonomic level, distinguishing between live and dead organisms. Individuals were considered to be alive when they had an organized cell structure with undamaged chloroplasts and cell wall (e.g. frustules for diatoms), among other structures. A maximum  counting error of 20% was accepted for the most abundant taxa ( Venrick, 1978 ). 2.2.3 PPP and HB populations (<2 μm) Picoplankton, which comprised different PPP populations, and HB were analyzed using a FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson®) flow cytometer equipped with a standard 15 mW blue argon-ion (488 nm emission) laser and a red laser diode (635 nm). Samples (3.6 mL) were fixed with 10% cold glutaraldehyde (1% final concentration), left in the dark for 10 min at room temperature and then stored at -80 °C. Two subsamples were taken for separate counts of HB and PPP. For HB, 400-μl samples were stained with SYBRGreen I (Sigma Aldrich®) diluted in DMSO to a final concentration of 1X, left for about 10 min in the dark to complete the nucleic-acid staining and run in the flow cytometer. A known volume of beads (1-μm diameter, Fluospheres®) was added to unfrozen samples. HB were detected by their signature in plots of side scatter light (SSC) versus green fluorescence of nucleic acid-bound stains FITC (FL1 530 nm) and SSC (side scatter) axes (e.g.  Gasol et al., 1999 ). Turbid samples were previously diluted with pre-filtered PBS (1:10). For PPP we used the same procedure as for HB, but without stain addition. Picoplanktonic algae were identified in plots of SSC versus blue laser-dependent red fluorescence (PerCP or FL3, 670 nm), orange fluorescence (PE or FL2 585/42 nm) versus FL3, and red laser-dependent far-red fluorescence (APC or FL4, 661 nm) versus FL3. 2.2.4 Analysis of the contribution of autotrophic fractions to total autotrophic biomass To compare the contribution of micro + nanophytoplankton and PPP populations to the autotrophic biomass at Tf, the biovolume of each size fraction was calculated for control and herbicide treatments for clear and turbid systems at Tf. The biovolume of micro + nano phytoplankton was calculated following  Rott (1981)  and  Hillebrand et al. (1999) . In regard to PPP, a sphere with a theoretical size of 0.9 μm was considered for PE-Pcy, PC-Pcy and PEuk, which represents a theoretical biovolume three times higher than that of Pcy ( Callieri, 2008 ). 2.3 Statistical and numerical analysis The homogeneity of the e.u. was verified in terms of water turbidity, for both turbid and clear systems, just before the addition of AsiMax 50® by a Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA by ranks test (KW). Statistical differences in turbidity, chlorophyll  a  concentration and abundance of micro + nano phytoplankton between turbidity states were analyzed at Tf using one-way ANOVA (factor treatment = control and six AsiMax 50® concentration levels). Multiple comparisons were carried out using Tukey test. The Holm-Sidak method was used to compare treated and control groups. RM-ANOVA was applied for testing the significance of PPP and HB counts, with two factors: time (T1 and Tf) and treatment (control and six AsiMax 50® concentration levels). For nano + micro phytoplankton, a Pearson correlation matrix was calculated among the abundances of live organisms of species from all treatments, for each type of system. Species that were recorded more than five times in all samples and in at least two e.u. of the same treatment, were included in the analysis. These matrices were incorporated into Cytoscape® v 3.7.1 software ( Shannon et al., 2003 ) to build networks among species. In addition, the following indices were calculated ( Magurran, 2013 ): richness (S); the Simpson index as 1-D, where D =  ∑ ( n i ( n i − 1 ) N ( N − 1 ) ) , ni is the number of organisms of the ith species and N is the total number of organisms; and evenness E= (1/D)/S). 3 Results 3.1 Physical and chemical parameters Real values of 2,4-D concentrations in water for each treatment at the beginning of the experiment (T1) are shown in  Table 1 .

No significant differences were found before AsiMax 50® addition between e.u. of the clear (KW, p = 0.511) and turbid (KW, p = 0.199) systems. At Tf, mean values of turbidity from all e.u. were 1.00 ± 0.00 and 13.33 ± 3.06 for the clear and turbid systems, respectively. In the turbid system, significant decreases in turbidity of 29%, 41% and 45% were observed at 20, 200 and 2,000 mg L −1  of 2,4-D compared to control at Tf, respectively (ANOVA; p < 0.01) ( Fig. 1 A).

There were significant decreases with respect to control in the 2,000 mg L −1  treatment: 36.7%, for the turbid (ANOVA; p = 0.006), and 76.9% for the clear system (ANOVA, p˂0.001). 3.2.2 Micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm) Table 2  shows a list of the species from the micro + nanoplanktonic fraction for the clear and turbid systems.

Under the clear condition and considering T0 and Tf, this group made up 71% of the total micro + nanoplankton abundance, followed by Dinophyceae (12.1%), Bacillariophyceae (8.86%), Crysophyceae (7.8%) and Cryptophyceae (0.2%). At T0, Chlorophyta represented 38.8% of the total abundance of the micro + nano planktonic fraction. At Tf, this group showed significant increases in abundance between the AsiMax 50® treatments and the control (ANOVA, p˂0.001), except for 2,000 mg L −1 , where the percentages of all groups were similar to those at T0 ( Fig. 2 A). In the turbid system, Chlorophyta dominated in richness and abundance, followed by Crysophyceae (1.2%), Cyanobacteria (0.8%) and Dinophyceae (0.6%). At T0, Chlorophyta made up 95.7% of the total abundance, and a significant increase was observed at Tf (ANOVA p = 0.046), with a mean value of 97.7% for all treatments ( Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 A-B. Abundance percentages of micro + nanophytoplanktonic groups at T0 (control) and Tf (control and 2,4-D concentrations) for clear and turbid systems. Fig. 2 In the clear system, mean total abundance of micro + nano plankton at T0 was 2,324 ± 352 individuals (ind) mL −1 , with 61.5% of live organisms ( Fig. 3 A). At Tf, mean total abundance for the control was ∼5 times greater than that at T0 (ANOVA, p = 0.003) while no AsiMax 50® effect was found on total abundance. In the turbid system, mean total abundance of micro + nano plankton at T0 was 663,603 ± 40,174 ind mL −1  (mean ± SD), with 90.2% of live organisms ( Fig. 3 B). At Tf, no significant change was recorded for the control between T0 and Tf. Moreover, the 0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg L −1  treatments led to a significant increase in the total abundance compared to control (ANOVA, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, the 200 and 2000 mg L −1  treatments did not differ significantly in total live abundances with respect to control. For both clear and turbid systems, data of the abundance of live organisms at Tf were fitted to second-order polynomial curves from all the herbicide treatments (Figs.  3  A and B). Better fit to a humped-shaped curve was found for the turbid (R 2  = 0.64) compared with the clear (R 2  = 0.41) system. Fig. 3 A-D. Phytoplankton abundances in relation to 2,4-D concentrations.

No significant differences were found before AsiMax 50® addition between e.u. of the clear (KW, p = 0.511) and turbid (KW, p = 0.199) systems. At Tf, mean values of turbidity from all e.u. were 1.00 ± 0.00 and 13.33 ± 3.06 for the clear and turbid systems, respectively. In the turbid system, significant decreases in turbidity of 29%, 41% and 45% were observed at 20, 200 and 2,000 mg L −1  of 2,4-D compared to control at Tf, respectively (ANOVA; p < 0.01) ( Fig. 1 A).

There were significant decreases with respect to control in the 2,000 mg L −1  treatment: 36.7%, for the turbid (ANOVA; p = 0.006), and 76.9% for the clear system (ANOVA, p˂0.001). 3.2.2 Micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm) Table 2  shows a list of the species from the micro + nanoplanktonic fraction for the clear and turbid systems.

Under the clear condition and considering T0 and Tf, this group made up 71% of the total micro + nanoplankton abundance, followed by Dinophyceae (12.1%), Bacillariophyceae (8.86%), Crysophyceae (7.8%) and Cryptophyceae (0.2%). At T0, Chlorophyta represented 38.8% of the total abundance of the micro + nano planktonic fraction. At Tf, this group showed significant increases in abundance between the AsiMax 50® treatments and the control (ANOVA, p˂0.001), except for 2,000 mg L −1 , where the percentages of all groups were similar to those at T0 ( Fig. 2 A). In the turbid system, Chlorophyta dominated in richness and abundance, followed by Crysophyceae (1.2%), Cyanobacteria (0.8%) and Dinophyceae (0.6%). At T0, Chlorophyta made up 95.7% of the total abundance, and a significant increase was observed at Tf (ANOVA p = 0.046), with a mean value of 97.7% for all treatments ( Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 A-B.

  "discussion": "4 Discussion Our results strongly suggest that the degree of water turbidity affects the response of the studied freshwater populations exposed for 7 days to the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50®. We found differences in the structural integrity of the phytoplankton and picoplankton communities from low to high concentrations of the active ingredient. The impact of AsiMax 50® on micro + nano phytoplankton seemed to be greater in the turbid than in the clear system, in terms of both richness and abundance. An experimental effect of the clear system on this fraction was likely to occur between T0 and Tf, compared to control. This was not observed in the turbid system and may be attributable to a “confinement effect” ( Pesce et al., 2009 ), which takes place after samples collected from a natural system are placed into microcosms of lower volume. At T0, phytoplankton diversity, richness and evenness were higher in the clear than in the turbid system. At Tf, no decrease in phytoplankton richness was observed for any treatment in the clear system, while it decreased significantly at 200 and 2,000 mg L −1  of 2,4-D in the turbid system. This suggests that some species cannot survive at the higher herbicide concentrations, in agreement with that reported for 2,4-D by  Kobraei and White (1996) . Communities with high levels of diversity tend to be more resilient to environmental changes ( Oliver et al., 2015 ), due to redundancy among different species sharing similar functions. Resilience increases if these species also show differential resistance to a contaminant. Indeed,  Girvan et al. (2005)  have demonstrated that bacterial diversity in soils promotes community stability and resilience after benzene perturbation. In the case of phytoplankton, it is expected that the differential sensitivity of species to herbicides ( Huertas et al., 2010 ) as well as their presence and relative abundance, will determine the response of the community as a whole. The richer the community, the greater the chance for the presence of tolerant or resistant species to a contaminant, and the response of the community will rely upon the evenness and sensitivity of the dominant species, if any. In general, natural or anthropogenic agents induce a wide range of responses in biological entities, according to their scale of complexity ( Peck, 2011 ). For example, variations in total abundance may reflect different physiological strategies. In our study, phytoplanktonic species that survived at 2,000 mg L −1  of 2,4-D in the clear system and at 200 and 2,000 mg L −1  of 2,4-D in the turbid system showed low abundance values due to decreased reproduction. A similar behavior was observed for phytoplankton exposed to the commercial glyphosate-based formulation RoundUp®, which had no effect on species richness but produced a significant strong decrease in total abundance ( Pérez et al., 2007 ). The abundance of the micro + nano phytoplankton community decreased at higher concentratio",
