  "abstract": "Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca 2+  signaling through the L-type Ca V 1.2 Ca 2+  channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells  in vitro  and  in vivo.  Whether Ca V 1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function Ca V 1.2 mutant channel (Ca V 1.2 TS ) using  Col2a1-Cre,  which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule.  Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS  mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by Î¼CT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that  Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS  mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of  Opg  and  Opg/Rankl  ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of Ca V 1.2 TS  mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that  Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS  mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the Ca V 1.2-dependent Ca 2+  influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca 2+  influx through Ca V 1.2 TS  promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis.",
