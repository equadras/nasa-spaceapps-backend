  "abstract": "The first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was for  Saccharomyces cerevisiae , as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently placed in the phyla  Mucoromycota  and  Zoopagomycota , were sequenced. The genome for  Rhizopus delemar  was completed in 2008; currently, more than 1000 zygomycete genomes have been sequenced. Genomic data from these early-diverging terrestrial fungi revealed deep phylogenetic separation of the two major clades—primarily plant—associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal  Mucoromycota  versus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the  Zoopagomycota . Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications. Pathogenicity genes and specialized secondary metabolites have also been detected in soil saprobes and pathogenic fungi. Novel endosymbiotic bacteria and viruses have been discovered during several zygomycete genome projects. Overall, genomic information has helped to resolve a plethora of research questions, from the placement of zygomycetes on the evolutionary tree of life and in natural ecosystems, to the applied biotechnological and medical questions.",

  "full_text": "1. Introduction The first “land” fungi retained their flagella for motility and remained adapted to life in water, and several diverging lineages switched to multicellularity while exploiting new environments [ 1 ]. A hallmark of the process of adapting to terrestrial life was the loss of the flagellum, which occurred independently several times during fungal evolution, giving rise to fungi with a hyphal growth form [ 2 ]. Prominent among early-divergent fungi is a group of lineages historically known as the zygomycetes, which are unified by similarities in reproductive biology (e.g., the formation of sexual zygospores via undifferentiated gametangia) and mostly do not form macroscopic fruiting bodies, making them more difficult to study than  Dikarya  [ 3 ]. Zygomycetes have also been challenging to study because many species are involved in obligate symbiotic interactions and have not been successfully grown in pure culture [ 4 ]. However, subsequent molecular studies have shown that the zygomycete fungi are paraphyletic [ 5 ]. Today, zygomycetes are recognized as two independent monophyletic groups divided into six subphyla [ 6 ]. Terrestrial environments posed novel challenges to early fungi, and the adaptive solutions that these lineages evolved can today be gleaned from the vast library of genes contained within their genomes [ 7 , 8 ]. While these first land colonizers are now extinct, many of their features are preserved in the genomes of extant zygomycetes. One instance, in which whole-genome data have proven useful, is in understanding the origin and evolution of fungi. About 450 million years ago, combined activities of fungi and plants placed the terrestrial world on a trajectory toward its current state, setting the stage for subsequent evolutionary transitions. Primitive mycorrhiza-like relationships and other forms of fungal–plant associations helped facilitate the successful colonization of land by the first terrestrial plants, and the genes responsible for such interactions are still preserved in fungal genomes [ 9 ]. Hence, zygomycete genomes have and will continue to play an integral role in our current understanding of the initial transition of organisms to land [ 10 ]. The number of sequenced fungal genomes continues to grow exponentially, and genomic data have become widely and freely accessible. While most sequenced genomes are from  Ascomycota  and  Basidiomycota  ( Dikarya ) species, there have been concerted efforts to sequence genomes of early-diverging and underrepresented lineages [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ]. Since 2014, the number of zygomycete genomes has grown from a dozen [ 16 ] to nearly a thousand. However, 70% of these genomes are still in the draft stage, and not all of them are available. While the number of species with sequenced genomes for all organisms is on the rise, the available pool of zygomycete genomes is exceptional due to its diversity, i.e., one-third of ca. 1000 known zygomycete species have already been sequenced ( Supplementary Table S1  [ 17 ]). The sequencing efforts have not been uniform among different groups of  Mucoromycota  and  Zoopagomycota ; for most species, only a single representative genome is available. While several major clades lack a single published genome (e.g.,  Eryniopsis  and  Neozygites  in  Entomophthoromycotina , and several genera in  Zoopagomycotina ), numerous isolates of several other species have been sequenced ( Figure 1 ). This discrepancy can be largely explained by practical interests since focal species are sometimes chosen for their relevance to human health or biotechnology [ 18 ]. In addition, some taxa are common in culture collections whereas other taxa are challenging to grow in vitro or presumably uncultivable [ 4 , 11 ]. The goal of this review is to (1) provide background into the methods that have been used to sequence zygomycete genomes and which genomes have been sequenced, and (2) consider insights into the genomic architecture, gene content, and evolutionary history gained from these data. 2. Sequencing the Zygomycetes Axenic cultures remain the preferred and most straightforward method of obtaining high-molecular-weight genomic DNA for sequencing projects [ 19 ]. Typically, the easier a species is to grow in culture, the easier it is to obtain pure, unfragmented DNA of high quality. In some cases, however, DNA from a single cell or even nuclei can be extracted and sequenced. This technique has been especially successful for the mycoparasites or fungal parasites of animals (e.g.,  Piptocephalis ,  Stylopage , and  Zoopage  [ 11 , 20 , 21 ]) or for resolving questions on genetic diversity of the nuclei in  Glomeromycotina , such as  Rhizophagus  [ 22 ]. When neither culturing nor single-cell genomics is possible, fungal DNA can be extracted along with that of the host organism. The two genomes can be distinguished bioinformatically (e.g., in the case of  Entomopthorales  pathogens of insects [ 23 ]). In rare cases, high-quality tissue from field-collected fruiting bodies can be used to generate genomes (e.g.,  Endogone ,  Jimgerdemannia , and  Modicella  [ 12 , 14 , 24 ]). The diversity of DNA sequencing technologies allows researchers to select the tools that are most appropriate for addressing specific questions but also requires setting minimal reporting standards for each type of sequencing technology. During sequence processing, genomic DNA is cut and sequenced in length spans from 100–300 base pairs (short reads, Illumina) to 1000–60,000 base pairs (long reads, PacBio, or MinION). Illumina short-read sequencing remains the dominant technology used to generate fungal genomes, while long-read technologies such as PacBio and Oxford nanopore are being used with increased frequency, especially for larger genomes ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Illumina sequencing generally provides the greatest sequencing quality and accuracy, although millions of short raw reads (150–300 bp) are produced; as a result, genome assembly can be challenging especially with genomes featuring large amounts of repetitive DNA. Assembly quality might be adjusted by combining the use of short reads from Illumina with long reads from another sequencing platform. The use of longer reads (up to 60,000 bp) facilitates read alignment and/or mapping, often achieving the length of the chromosome [ 25 ] and allows precise resolution of repetitive sequences of rDNA [ 26 ]. However, PacBio and other long-read technologies typically demand higher quality and quantity of DNA than Illumina. On the other hand, these technologies are changing rapidly as different companies compete for the market share and make efforts to increase the number and length of reads and to maintain and improve sequence accuracy [ 27 ]. The majority of zygomycete genomes are assembled de novo, even when assemblies of closely related species are already available. Choice of assembly software usually depends on the data type. For example, AllPaths-LG works best for assembling Illumina short-read sequences, while Falcon is preferred for longer PacBio reads ( Supplementary Table S1 ) [ 28 ]. The most widely used genome assemblers for zygomycetes include gsAssembler (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), Newbler [ 18 ], Velvet [ 29 ], Arachne, Celera [ 30 ], HGAP [ 31 ], JGI Jazz (especially among earlier assemblies from 2001–2014) [ 32 ], Ray [ 33 ], CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0 ( https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com , accessed on 10 July 2023), MaSuRCA [ 34 ], Falcon, AllPaths-LG [ 35 ], SOAPdenovo [ 36 ], SPAdes [ 37 ], SOLiD [ 38 ], Canu [ 39 ], FinisherSC [ 40 ], Flye [ 41 ], and MEGAHIT [ 42 ] ( Figure 2 ). Most zygomycete genome assemblies are similar in size to the average fungal genome: 30–50 Mb ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Notable exceptions include species in  Entomophthoromycotina ,  Glomeromycotina , and  Mucoromycotina , whose large genomes compare in size to  Arabidopsis thaliana  (135 Mb),  Caenorhabditis elegans  (100 Mb), or  Drosophila melanogaster  (140 Mb) [ 43 , 44 ]. However, there are still far smaller than the genomes of some of the Basidiomycete fungi that cause rust diseases on plants, which includes the largest fungal genome sequenced to date ( Austropuccinia psidii , 1 Gb) [ 45 ]. Most zygomycete genomes contain over 10,000 predicted genes.  Rhizophagus  spp. ( Glomeromycotina ) are a notable exception; they contain more than double the typical number with 26–30 K predicted genes ( Figure 3 ). The smallest numbers of genes are found in  Zoopagomycotina  (4–8 K), followed by 6–11 K in  Kickxellomycotina , 9–16 K in  Entomophthoromycotina ,  Mucoromycotina  and  Mortierellomycotina , and 20–30 K in  Glomeromycotina  ( Supplementary Table S1 ). However, these numbers may change for  Entomophthoromycotina  and  Zoopagomycotina  since there are only a few representative genomes available for those lineages. During the assembly process DNA sequences are combined into contigs, which are sometimes merged to form scaffolds (if sufficient evidence exists to support these merges). These scaffolds of assembled DNA sequences should ideally equal the number of chromosomes [ 46 ]. In practice, the number of scaffolds rarely matches exactly the number of chromosomes and, for most species, the exact number of chromosomes is unknown [ 47 ]. Many genomes of easily culturable  Mucoromycota  with small genomes have the lowest number of scaffolds (e.g., 12 in  Actinomortierella wolfii ), while the genomes of species with larger genomes (e.g., taxa in  Glomeromycotina  and  Entomophthoromycotina ) are more fragmented such as 210 contigs in  Rhizophagus irregularis  [ 26 ], or 373,021 in  Massospora cicadina  [ 48 ]. These larger assemblies are due to larger overall genomes (e.g., larger number of chromosomes) and because of the difficulties with assembly caused by polyploidy, numerous repeats, and transposons [ 49 ]; these aspects are prevalent in many  Mucoromycota  and  Zoopagomycota  genomes ( Supplementary Table S1 ). However, the sequenced genomes with hundreds of thousands of scaffolds often reflect low sequence coverage relative to the size of the genome, resulting in highly fragmented assemblies. All these factors contribute to the number of the scaffolds, not reflecting the actual numbers of chromosomes. Genome quality is also improved by increasing the sequence coverage. Some zygomycete genomes have been sequenced at a depth of 500–700× and many genome projects aim for a mean depth of ca. 100× coverage ( Supplement Table S1 ). High-quality genome assemblies rely on increased sequencing depth, particularly in cases of high intraspecific polymorphism or variable genome architecture, e.g., species of  Glomeromycotina  and many noncoding regions and transposons, as in the genomes of  Entomophthoromycotina  species. However, some researchers have used low-coverage genome sequencing (ca. 10× coverage) as a cheap and efficient method to obtain a smaller number of orthologous gene regions for phylogenomic analyses [ 12 , 15 , 24 ]. 3. Genomes and the Evolution of the Zygomycetes The first genome sequence of a zygomycete fungus was from a clinical strain of  Rhizopus delemar  that was isolated from a patient with mucormycosis—a highly destructive and lethal infection that is typically seen in immunocompromised hosts. Sequencing of the  R. delemar  genome was driven from the clinical perspective, but it also provided the first genome of a fungus outside of the  Dikarya  [ 18 ]. Moving forward a decade, a landmark project generated genomic sequences of all species known to cause mucoromycosis in humans. Thirty zygomycete genomes were sequenced and assembled for this project [ 50 ]. Another substantial advance in zygomycete genomics was made by the ZyGoLife team, comprising the efforts of 12 mycological labs across the USA and Canada in collaboration with the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [ 14 ]. The phylogenomic study by Spatafora et al. [ 6 ] found that the former  Zygomycota  phylum was not monophyletic but instead comprised two distinct lineages—the primarily plant-associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal  Mucoromycota  versus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the  Zoopagomycota . However, further analyses using phylogenomics data to resolve the evolutionary relationships of zygomycetes have yielded slightly conflicting results. Although  Zoopagomycota  and  Mucoromycota  are maintained as monophyletic lineages, a recent study by Li et al. [ 51 ] found that  Zoopagomycota  and  Mucoromycota  formed one larger monophyletic clade in some (but not all) of their analyses. In contrast, other recent phylogenomic studies by Strassert and Monaghan [ 52 ] and Galindo et al. [ 53 ] recovered a topology that was similar to Spatafora et al. [ 6 ], where the  Zoopagomycota  were resolved as the sister group to all terrestrial fungi. In many of the studies, the position of  Glomeromycotina  has been problematic, suggesting that more work will be needed to resolve the placement of this clade [ 51 , 54 ]. One of the greatest debates in early-diverging fungal evolution was the ploidy of the dominant life form given the predominantly haploid nature seen in the  Dikarya . One outcome of the analysis of genome sequences of zygomycetes species is that diploids are more common than expected [ 9 , 55 , 56 , 57 ]. 3.1. Mucoromycota Mucoromycota  comprises many critically important plant symbionts, including the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( Glomeromycotina ) [ 58 ],  Endogonales  ( Mucoromycotina ) [ 24 ], “fine root endophytes” ( Mucoromycotina ) [ 59 ], and putative root endophytic species including  Mortierella  ( Mortierellomycotina ) [ 60 ],  Pygmaeomycetaceae  ( Mucoromycotina ) [ 61 ], and  Umbelopsis  ( Mucoromycotina ) [ 62 ]. On the other hand, many fungi within this group are also noted plant pathogens (e.g.,  Rhizopus microsporus , which causes rice seedling blight, and various  Choanephora ,  Gilbertella , and  Mucor  species that cause post-harvest rots) as well as numerous species ( Actinomucor ,  Apophysomyces ,  Cokeromyces ,  Cunninghamella ,  Lichtheimia ,  Mucor ,  Rhizomucor ,  Rhizopus ,  Saksenea ,  Syncephalastrum ) that can cause the disease mucormycosis in humans and other animals [ 63 ]. Most zygomycete genomes are of species within  Mucoromycota  ( Figure 1 ); as a result, much of what we know about genome evolution among early-diverging fungi comes from this phylum. Genome duplication appears to have played a significant role in their evolution, as first described for  Rhizopus delemar  and  Mucor circinelloides  [ 18 , 64 ]. Genome sequencing has also revealed a diversity of endobacteria that may be found as symbionts in the  Mucoromycota , e.g., in  Rhizopus microsporus  and  Endogone pisiformis  ( Mucoromycotina ),  Linnemannia elongata  and  Mortierella alpina  ( Mortierellomycotina ), and  Rhizophagus irregularis  ( Glomeromycotina ) [ 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 ]. Many plant-associated fungal lineages contain endobacteria, but the potential role of these symbionts in the land colonization process remain to be characterized. “Foreign” DNA in the form of diverse mycoviruses has also been frequently detected during genome sequencing of zygomycetes [ 30 , 71 ]. Genomics enabled the systematic study of genome architecture [ 72 , 73 , 74 ], genetic manipulations [ 75 ], and intra-isolate genomic variations [ 76 ]. Genome-wide searches and comparisons have also detected evidence for transposon spread through genomes [ 77 , 78 , 79 ] and uniquely high 6-methyladenine DNA modifications in zygomycete fungi as compared to  Dikarya  [ 80 ]. Studies on metabolic patterns across the fungal kingdom, the search for the mating gene loci and protein families [ 81 , 82 , 83 ], and the phylogenies of certain taxonomic groups [ 84 , 85 ] have also been conducted using-whole genome sequencing data. Genome-based research has also provided insights into the trophic modes of zygomycete fungi, including the evolution of mycorrhizae [ 24 , 86 ] and commonalities in the pathogenicity of Mucoralean fungi [ 50 , 87 ]. 3.2. Mucoromycotina Genome sequencing of this subphylum has been the most comprehensive among all the basal fungal lineages although genomes are still unavailable for several genera, including species of  Siepmannia ,  Chlamydoabsidia , and  Utharomyces , as well as for two new root-associated species of  Pygmaeomyces  of the new genus and family  Pygmaeomycetaceae  [ 61 ]. Furthermore, the plant-associated order  Endogonales  remains highly undersampled despite recent advances [ 24 , 88 ]. Some of its “fine root endophytes” colonize early-diverging plants, and sometimes co-occur with AMF [ 89 , 90 ]. The average genome size in  Mucoromycotina  species ranges from 35 to 50 Mbp, with species of  Umbelopsis  at the low end of the spectrum (22–30 Mbp) and  Endogonales  such as  Jimgerdemannia  species at the higher end (240 Mbp) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). For some genera, several hundred genomes have already been sequenced. For example, there are >220 genomes available for species of  Rhizopus , mostly of  R. arrhizus  (syn.  R. oryzae ) and its varieties and synonyms, and of  R. microsporus ,  R. delemar , and  R. stolonifer  ( Supplement Table S1 ).  Rhizopus  is increasingly studied as a model organism thanks to its availability in culture collections and to its important role in biotechnology and human health. Genomic information might be helpful for future studies of pathogenicity in  Rhizopus  species since infections by members of this genus are the leading cause of human mucormycosis [ 50 , 84 ]. Phylogenomic data suggest that species of  Rhizopus  are part of a well resolved monophyletic group. However, this is in stark contrast to the situation among members of the genus  Mucor  (>150 genomes), which is incredibly diverse and is likely polyphyletic ( Figure 4 ). The additional  Mucoromycotina  genomes consist mostly of saprotrophic species that are relevant to human health (species of  Lichtheimia  and  Cunninghamella ) and biotechnology ( Phycomyces blakesleeanus ) [ 91 , 92 , 93 ]. Genomes of  Endogonales  (as well as  Glomeromycotina ) contain effectors to facilitate plant–fungus interactions, which apparently aided in the terrestrialization of Earth by early land plants. Genome information helped to describe and clarify the phylogenetic placement of new lineages and species, such as  Bifiguratus  [ 94 ] and  Calcarisporiella  [ 95 ]. 3.3. Mortierellomycotina This subphylum contains an estimated 170 species [ 96 ] and was recently circumscribed into 13 monophyletic genera using multi-locus and low-coverage genome sequencing [ 12 ]. Reference genome sequences of both low quality and high quality are now available for representatives for most genera, including  Actinomortierella ,  Benniella ,  Dissophora ,  Entomortierella ,  Gamsiella ,  Gryganskiella ,  Linnemannia ,  Lobosporangium ,  Lunasporangiospora ,  Mortierella ,  Necromortierella ,  Podila , and the sporocarpic genus  Modicella  [ 12 , 97 ]. A high diversity of  Mortierellomycotina  species can be isolated from soil, but it appears that genera may differ in their ecological roles. For example,  Necromortierella  species appear to be necrotrophic, whereas  Actinomortierella  spp. are often associated with millipedes, and  Entomortierella  spp. are often associated with arthropods [ 98 ]. Many genera, such as  Linnemannia  and  Podila , have been recovered as rhizosphere associates and endophytes of plant roots [ 99 , 100 ], and they appear to improve plant growth and impact flower and seed production [ 101 ]. Several species such as  Mortierella alpina  have been sequenced due to their use in industry and biotechnology for lipid production [ 102 ]. 3.4. Glomeromycotina Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs) are arguably the most common and oldest sy",

  "conclusion": "5. Conclusions There has been renewed research interest in the zygomycete fungi during the last decade, and this is reflected in the rapidly increasing number of genome sequences from this group of fungi. While the quality of the genomes varies according to the sequencing platform and starting materials available, the genomes are sufficient for phylogenomic reconstructions, as well as for the discovery of functional genes and gene clusters of interest. Much of the work has focused on several key topics, including the evolution and phylogeny of the group, adaptation, and transition to a terrestrial habitat (e.g., light and gravity sensors, and reinforcement of cell-wall structure to tolerate a nonaquatic environment), genome duplication, endosymbionts and horizontal gene transfer, genome architecture, pathogenicity, and coevolution with host species. The number of genomes has grown rapidly over the past decade, and we expect that the next decade will bring increased taxon sampling (e.g., new genomes for taxa that have not yet been sampled) and improvements in genome quality due to advances in long-read sequencing technologies and bioinformatics approaches. In the future, we expect that genomic analyses of these fungi will take new directions, including a detailed comparison of the genomes of aquatic vs. terrestrial lineages, structural studies, a comparison of the zygomycete vs.  Dikarya  genomes, experimental manipulations of host/parasite interactions to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathogenesis, and building links among genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data."
