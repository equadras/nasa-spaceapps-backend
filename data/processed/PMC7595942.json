  "full_text": "ANNOUNCEMENT The family  Bacillaceae  is composed of mostly aerobic or facultatively anaerobic rods with a Gram-positive cell wall. Members of this group are ubiquitous in nature, found in soil, sediments, air, freshwater, marine ecosystems, and foods and in extreme environments with high temperatures ( 1 ).  Bacillaceae  groups are reported to produce a wide range of valuable and thermostable extracellular enzymes ( 2 ). The majority of  Bacillaceae  can form endospores that are crucial for survival in harsh environments ( 3 ,  4 ). This spore-forming property makes it important for NASA planetary protection purposes because spore-forming bacteria are more likely to survive sterilization procedures and the harsh environments of outer space, making them a potential threat for forward contamination ( 5 ). This report presents the draft genome sequences of three species ( Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ,  Bacillus cereus , and  Paenibacillus polymyxa ) belonging to the family  Bacillaceae , isolated from predefined surfaces at various locations on the International Space Station. The samples were collected using premoistened polyester wipes ( 6 ), brought back to Earth, aseptically transferred to a 500-ml bottle containing 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, mixed by vigorously shaking, and concentrated via a filtration system. An appropriate aliquot of each sample was inoculated onto either Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) (25°C; 7 days) or blood (37°C; 2 days) agar. A single colony from each incubated plate was used for genomic DNA extraction using the ZymoBIOMICS MagBead DNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Zymo Research, USA). All isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing based on similarity to their type strain 16S rRNA, as previously reported ( 6 ). To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol ( 7 ), using NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell 2 × 150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verification of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried out using FastQC v0.11.7 ( 8 ). Quality control for adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp v0.20.0 ( 9 ), and then SPAdes v3.11.1 ( 10 ) was used to assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control was based on the following three parameters: (i) correction of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and (iii) quality trimming at the 5′ and 3′ ends. To determine the quality of the assembled sequences, the number of contigs, the  N \n 50  value, and the total length were calculated using QUAST v5.0.2 ( 11 ). Default parameters were used for all software. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) ( 12 ) was calculated using OrthoANIu by comparing each of the 29  Bacillaceae  scaffolds to the WGS of the respective type strains. The ANI range was 93.98% to 94.17% for  B. amyloliquefaciens , and the ANI was 98% for both  B. cereus  and  P. polymyxa . All other genomic statistics are given in  Table 1 .
