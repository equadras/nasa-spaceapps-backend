  "abstract": "Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain-dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, were further characterized for proteomic, and metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No significant metabolome alterations were revealed. Lastly, ISSFT-021-30 conidia re-exposed to UV-C exhibited enhanced UV-C resistance when compared to the conidia of unexposed ISSFT-021.",

  "full_text": "Introduction Extremophiles are of interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) due to their potential to survive hostile and extraterrestrial conditions ( Rummel et al., 2002 ). Bacteria, fungi, and archaea have been shown to thrive in habitats characterized by low nutrient availability ( Onofri et al., 2004 ), desiccation ( Barnard et al., 2013 ), high and low temperatures ( McKay et al., 2003 ;  Onofri et al., 2007 ), acidic and alkaline pH ( Gonzalez-Toril et al., 2003 ;  Gonsalves, 2012 ), or radiation ( Zhdanova et al., 2004 ;  Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008 ;  Fendrihan et al., 2009 ;  Stan-Lotter and Fendrihan, 2013 ). There is a need for studies that focus on elucidating microbial survival mechanisms in extreme habitats, as a primary goal of the planetary protection policy is to prevent forward and backward contamination of any celestial bodies and the Earth ( Rummel et al., 2002 ). So far, the majority of such studies have focused on investigating extremophilic bacteria, mainly spore-formers ( Nicholson et al., 2012 ;  Tirumalai et al., 2013 ), and rocks containing fungi ( Onofri et al., 2012 ;  Zakharova et al., 2014 ) however, monolayers of fungal conidia have not been studied. One investigation revealed that the survival of spacecraft-associated bacteria under simulated Mars UV irradiation, is strain-specific and depends on the isolation site ( Newcombe et al., 2005 ). Spacecraft-associated bacteria were more resistant than  Bacillus subtillis  168, used as a dosimetric control ( Newcombe et al., 2005 ). Additionally, exposure of  B. subtilis  168 spores to dark space conditions (no UV) outside the International Space Station (ISS) and SMC for 559 days induced the expression of genes involved in DNA and protein damage responses, and oxidative and envelope stress ( Nicholson et al., 2012 ). Further, the first-generation of spores of another bacterium,  Bacillus pumillus  SAFR-032, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) was more UV-C resistant than the ground control counterparts following exposure to space UV conditions for 18 months. Extensive studies into the whole genome of SAFR-032 revealed the presence of several DNA repair-associated genes that may have facilitated its survival and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Further, proteome analysis showed that stress response proteins, like superoxide dismutase, were increased in abundance when compared to the control ( Vaishampayan et al., 2012 ). Fungi produce conidia or spores as part of their life cycle. Some of these structures can be more resistant to environmental impact than the typical fungal coenocytic cell. Therefore, molecular characterization and further understanding of fungal resistance to UV-C and SMC are of high importance. Additionally, fungi possess a wide variety of mechanisms to protect against solar radiation, which include enzymes removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photoreactivation (PR), and the production of pigments such as melanins and melanin-like compounds, and UV-absorbing metabolites that act as sunscreens ( Braga et al., 2015 ). The hardy nature, adaptability and plasticity of fungi enable their persistence in extreme conditions, making them potential contaminants of cleanrooms and, therefore, a forward contamination source. On April 25, 1986 one of the most significant nuclear accidents in history took place. Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) exploded and high levels of released radioactivity turned the surrounding area into a hostile environment. Within the following 18 years over 2,000 fungal isolates were collected from the nuclear power plant, its 30-km Exclusion Zone and beyond, representing some 200 species in over 90 genera ( Zhdanova et al., 2004 ). The observed fungal communities were of low complexity and dominated by melanin-containing strains. Approximately 20% of the isolates displayed a previously unknown phenomenon of growing toward the radiation source referred to as positive radiotropism ( Zhdanova et al., 2004 ;  Dighton et al., 2008 ). Therefore, this unique characteristic of Chernobyl fungi makes them an ideal fungal model for studying adaptation to SMC. Further, the fungal species isolated from Chernobyl have also been detected in built environments, including JPL clean rooms ( La Duc et al., 2012 ;  Weinmaier et al., 2015 ), simulated closed habitats ( Blachowicz et al., 2017 ), and on board of the ISS ( Checinska et al., 2015 ), which further emphasizes the need to study their potential for forward contamination. The ISS is another type of environment that may be considered hostile for microorganisms, featuring constant temperature and humidity, controlled airflow, enhanced irradiation, and microgravity ( Mora et al., 2016 ). Several reports examining microbial burden aboard the ISS have shown that fungal populations thrive in this environment ( Checinska et al., 2015 ;  Be et al., 2017 ). Other studies have investigated molecular adaptations of selected species to space conditions, revealing changes in metabolome, and proteome of ISS-isolated strains ( Knox et al., 2016 ;  Romsdahl et al., 2018 ;  Blachowicz et al., 2019 ). In other investigations, several multilayered or embedded cryptoendolithic fungal communities were exposed to space conditions ( Billi et al., 2011 ;  Onofri et al., 2012 ,  2015 ;  Scalzi et al., 2012 ;  Pacelli et al., 2018 ). Tested isolates that adapted to environmental extremes of their habitats survived SMC for extended periods and revealed high stability of the DNA in the surviving cells ( Billi et al., 2011 ;  Onofri et al., 2015 ;  Pacelli et al., 2018 ). Despite these studies, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that facilitate survival of filamentous fungi under SMC and their potential to adapt and survive in outer space. This is the first report that evaluated the survival of Chernobyl-associated and ISS-isolated fungal conidia exposed in monolayers to SMC. Dried monolayers of conidia of four filamentous fungi were exposed to SMC and two strains,  Aspergillus fumigatus  and  Cladosporium cladosporoides , which survived exposure to SMC for 30 min, were further analyzed for phenotypic, proteomic and metabolomic changes. Results Identification of Fungal Strains Twelve fungal strains isolated from Chernobyl nuclear accident sites, belonging to nine genera, and one ISS-isolated strain were included in this study. Eight of the Chernobyl isolates were collected over time from the wall surface of the exploded Unit-4 of ChNPP. The other four fungi isolated from soil within the exclusion zone were included for comparison. The strains used in the study were selected based on their ecological and biological significance from the collection of over 2,000 isolates. Speciation was determined by classical cell and colony morphology-based identification techniques. A smaller set of fungi underwent whole genome sequencing.

Survival of Desiccated Conidial Spores Under UV-C Irradiation The impact of UV-C irradiation on the survival of dried fungal conidia is presented in  Supplementary Table 1 . Out of 13 irradiated strains, all but three ( Beauveria bassiana  IMV 00265,  Fusarium oxysporum  IMV 00293, and  Aureobasidium pullulans  IMV 00882) survived exposure to the dose of 2,000 J/m 2 . Two radiotropic strains,  Cladosporium sphaerospermum  IMV 00045, and  Cladosporium cladosporioides  IMV 00236, and the non-radiotropic  Penicillium citreonigrum  IMV 00738 showed survival at the level of 3.48, 3.60, and 2.18%, respectively, which was higher than the ∼0.1% survival rate observed for the other strains ( Figure 1  and  Supplementary Table 1 ). Rapid decrease in conidia survivability was observed at dose of 500 J/m 2  (∼2–3 log reduction). From that point until the doses of 1000 or 2000 J/m 2 , the decrease in survival was less pronounced. FIGURE 1 UV-C resistance of Chernobyl and ISS-isolated fungal strains. Purified conidia of 13 strains were exposed to various UV-C doses. The UV-C survival rates were calculated using formula: N/N 0 , # of conidia survived at any given dose/# of conidia exposed at Time 0. Survival of Desiccated Conidia Under Simulated Mars Conditions (SMC) Based on the initial analysis of survival under SMC (not shown) four fungal strains were exposed to SMC for 5 and 30 min at the Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Netherlands. All exposed strains,  C. cladosporioides  IMV 00236,  Apiospora montagnei  IMV 01851,  C. herbarum  IMV 00034 and  A. fumigatus  ISSFT-021, survived exposure to SMC for 5 min, whereas only two strains:  C. cladosporioides  IMV 00236 and  A. fumigatus  ISSFT-021 survived exposure for 30 min ( Table 2 ). Probably the most striking observation was the highest survival rate of IMV 00034 after 5 min exposure to SMC followed by complete eradication after 30 min exposure to SMC. However, because the main focus of the manuscript was to discuss the potential of fungi to survive long-term exposure to SMC we did not further investigate why IMV 00034 may be highly tolerant to SMC-exposure for the short time, but it fails to survive during longer exposure. Nevertheless, it remains an interesting question and a topic for further investigation.

Secondary Metabolite (SM) Profiling of  Aspergillus fumigatus  and  Cladosporium cladosporioides  Exposed to SMC Organic extracts of unexposed ISSFT-021 and IMV 00236, and 30 min SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30 strains were examined to test if exposure to SMC alters SM production. No significant differences were observed in SM production when comparing samples before and after SMC exposure, including yield or type of compound produced, in either of the strains ( Figure 2 ). However, there appeared to be a tendency of increased SM production yield in both strains following exposure to SMC when compared to unexposed counterparts ( Figure 2B,D ).

Proteome Profiling of  Aspergillus fumigatus  Exposed to SMC The proteomic characterization of SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 revealed 51-up and 24 down-regulated proteins when compared to unexposed ISSFT-021 (fold-change (FC) > | 2|,  P  < 0.05) ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Analysis of the distribution of differentially expressed proteins among biological processes revealed that 27 proteins were involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, 11 in carbohydrate metabolism, and 10 in stress response ( Figure 3 ). Further, significantly over-represented up-regulated biological processes included translation (50% of all up-regulated proteins), and carbohydrate metabolic processes (15%), whereas significantly over-represented down-regulated processes included carbohydrate derivative metabolic processes (12%) ( Supplementary Table 3 ). FIGURE 3 AspGD GO Slim terms of differentially expressed proteins in ISSFT-021-30. Differentially expressed proteins in (FC > |2|,  P  < 0.05) were mapped to terms representing various biological processes using AspGD gene ontology (GO) Slim Mapper. Approximately 50% of all up-regulated proteins in ISSFT-021-30 were involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, including proteins that comprise the small and large ribosomal subunit ( Table 3 ). The majority of these proteins were reported to be differentially expressed during the early development of  A. fumigatus  ( Cagas et al., 2011 ). Both Rpl3 (AFUA_2G11850) and ribosomal protein P0 (AFUA_1G05080), whose expression during conidiation are regulated by BrlAp, were more than twofold up-regulated ( Twumasi-Boateng et al., 2009 ). A number of differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism ( Table 4 ), including isocitrate lyase AcuD (AFUA_4G13510), one of the key enzymes in the glyoxylate cycle ( Olivas et al., 2008 ). Cellobiohydrolases CbhB (AFUA_6G11610) and AFUA_8G01490, both involved in cellulose degradation, and hydrolase AFUA_5G07080 were more than twofold up-regulated in SMC-exposed ISSFT-021-30 ( Adav et al., 2013 ). A twofold increase in protein abundance was observed for glycerol dehydrogenase GldB (AFUA_4G11730) ( Teutschbein et al., 2010 ), phosphoglycerate kinase (AFUA_1G10350), and hexokinase HxkA (AFUA_2G05910) ( Albrecht et al., 2010 ). Among the proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism that exhibited decreased abundance were malate and alcohol dehydrogenases [AFUA_6G05210 ( Teutschbein et al., 2010 ), AFUA_5G06240 ( Cagas et al., 2011 ), respectively] and mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (AFUA_4G08410) ( Gautam et al., 2011 ). Several proteins with increased abundance were involved in response to stress ( Table 5 ). Dehydrin-like protein DprC (AFUA_7G04520), which is known to play a role in protecting cells against freezing ( Hoi et al., 2011 ), and AFUA_1G14090, which is predicted to be involved in histidine biosynthesis ( Nierman et al., 2005 ), were twofold up-regulated. Down-regulated stress response proteins included the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (AFUA_1G04900), and the formaldehyde dehydrogenase (AFUA_2G01040), and AFUA_8G04890 with a predicted role in response to salt stress ( Nierman et al., 2005 ).

  "methods": "Materials and Methods Sample Collection Sites Subcultures of the isolated strains were obtained from the Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, within the framework of a multiyear collaborative research program, to the Center for Environmental Biotechnology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). For this study 12 Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated isolates were selected ( Table 1 ). Preparation of Aluminum Coupons With Monolayers of Dried Fungal Conidia High-grade aluminum coupons (Al 6061-T6) were precision cleaned for sterility as previously described ( Osman et al., 2008 ). Each coupon was seeded with 100 μL of conidia suspension to contain ∼10 5  conidia per coupon. Conidia were counted using a hemocytometer (Double Neubauer Counting Chamber, Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA, United States) after harvesting 5 days grown cultures at 26°C on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Conidial suspensions were diluted in molecular biology grade water (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and ∼10 5  conidia were added to each coupon followed by drying overnight at the room temperature in a bio-hood. The monolayers of conidia were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (data not shown). UV-C Exposure and Recovery Aluminum coupons with dried fungal conidia were placed in a plastic Petri dish, without a lid, and exposed to UV-C using a low-pressure handheld mercury arc UV lamp (model UVG-11; UVP Inc., Upland, CA, United States). The lamp was placed above the sample, and the UV flux at the surface of exposed sample was measured using UVX digital radiometer (UVP Inc.). The exposure time required to produce doses: 0, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 2,000 J/m 2  was calculated at 100 μW cm -2 . After exposure to UV-C 100 μL of 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was applied on each coupon and dried at 37°C for 50 min. Dried PVA along with fungal conidia was peeled using sterile forceps and added to 1 mL of molecular biology grade water (Fisher Scientific). The PVA extraction step was repeated. When PVA was dissolved, serial dilutions were prepared and plated on PDA in duplicates. Colony forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation at 26°C. Simulated Martian Conditions (SMC) Survival and response of fungal strains under SMC were tested in a Mars simulation chamber equipped with a UV transparent fused silica window according to a previously described set up ( Garry et al., 2006 ;  Osman et al., 2008 ;  Peeters et al., 2010 ). Coupons prepared following the protocol described above were placed in the sterile Falcon tubes and sent to Netherlands. After arrival (∼1.5 weeks) samples deposited on aluminum coupons were placed inside the simulation chamber and subsequently the chamber was evacuated  via  an oil-free scroll pump (XDS5, Edwards Vacuum, Crawley, United Kingdom) to reach a base pressure of 20 Pa. While continuously being pumped, the chamber was purged five times with high purity CO 2  (99.995%, H 2 0 < 5 ppm",
  "results": "Results Identification of Fungal Strains Twelve fungal strains isolated from Chernobyl nuclear accident sites, belonging to nine genera, and one ISS-isolated strain were included in this study. Eight of the Chernobyl isolates were collected over time from the wall surface of the exploded Unit-4 of ChNPP. The other four fungi isolated from soil within the exclusion zone were included for comparison. The strains used in the study were selected based on their ecological and biological significance from the collection of over 2,000 isolates. Speciation was determined by classical cell and colony morphology-based identification techniques. A smaller set of fungi underwent whole genome sequencing.

Survival of Desiccated Conidial Spores Under UV-C Irradiation The impact of UV-C irradiation on the survival of dried fungal conidia is presented in  Supplementary Table 1 . Out of 13 irradiated strains, all but three ( Beauveria bassiana  IMV 00265,  Fusarium oxysporum  IMV 00293, and  Aureobasidium pullulans  IMV 00882) survived exposure to the dose of 2,000 J/m 2 . Two radiotropic strains,  Cladosporium sphaerospermum  IMV 00045, and  Cladosporium cladosporioides  IMV 00236, and the non-radiotropic  Penicillium citreonigrum  IMV 00738 showed survival at the level of 3.48, 3.60, and 2.18%, respectively, which was higher than the ∼0.1% survival rate observed for the other strains ( Figure 1  and  Supplementary Table 1 ). Rapid decrease in conidia survivability was observed at dose of 500 J/m 2  (∼2–3 log reduction). From that point until the doses of 1000 or 2000 J/m 2 , the decrease in survival was less pronounced. FIGURE 1 UV-C resistance of Chernobyl and ISS-isolated fungal strains. Purified conidia of 13 strains were exposed to various UV-C doses. The UV-C survival rates were calculated using formula: N/N 0 , # of conidia survived at any given dose/# of conidia exposed at Time 0. Survival of Desiccated Conidia Under Simulated Mars Conditions (SMC) Based on the initial analysis of survival under SMC (not shown) four fungal strains were exposed to SMC for 5 and 30 min at the Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Netherlands. All exposed strains,  C. cladosporioides  IMV 00236,  Apiospora montagnei  IMV 01851,  C. herbarum  IMV 00034 and  A. fumigatus  ISSFT-021, survived exposure to SMC for 5 min, whereas only two strains:  C. cladosporioides  IMV 00236 and  A. fumigatus  ISSFT-021 survived exposure for 30 min ( Ta",
  "discussion": "Discussion Although it has been well documented that bacteria are associated with the spacecraft environment ( La Duc et al., 2003 ,  2004 ;  Newcombe et al., 2005 ), few studies address the persistence of fungi in this environment ( La Duc et al., 2012 ;  Weinmaier et al., 2015 ). Prepared in monolayers, spacecraft-associated spore-forming bacteria have been shown to survive exposure to UV-C and SMC ( Newcombe et al., 2005 ;  Osman et al., 2008 ), but similar studies have not been performed for fungal conidia. Microorganisms exposed as multilayers are shielded from UV penetration (submicron level) and subsequent UV-damage is prevented, therefore generation of monolayers of tested cells/spores/conidia is crucial for characterizing irradiation-induced microbial lethality. The observed strain-dependent UV-C sensitivity of fungal conidia was not surprising, as similar conclusions were drawn for UV-exposed bacterial species ( Osman et al., 2008 ). Interestingly, ten out of thirteen selected fungal species survived the UV-C dose of 2,000 J/m 2 , while bacterial species in a similar study survived exposure to 1,000 J/m 2  ( Osman et al., 2008 ), suggesting that some extremophilic fungi are as hardy, if not more, than tested bacteria. It should be noted, that conducting experiments that investigate the protective nature of fungi or bacteria could help in understanding the microbial survival in extreme niches, as bacteria and fungi coexist in the environment, and form communities to survive harsh conditions. The space environment varies significantly from Earth. It is characterized by enhanced irradiation and distinct atmospheric conditions. Therefore, it was imperative to assess fungal survival under SMC, as fungi are known to be present during manned space missions. Among the four strains that survived 5-min exposure to SMC two, ISSFT-021 and IMV 00236, survived exposure to SMC for 30 min. Most studies testing survival of microorganisms under SMC have been conducted using bacterial spores or fungal communities. In one such study several  Bacillus  spp. were tested for simulated Mars UV irradiation tolerance, which resulted in no survival beyond 30 min exposure for all strains except  B. pumilus  SAFR-032, which was inactivated after 180 min of exposure ( Schuerger et al., 2006 ). However, when  B. subtilis  spores were exposed to SMC, including irradiation and atmospheric conditions, 99.9% of spores were eradicated within 30 s, and a 15 min exposure resulted in no recovery of viable spores from aluminum coupons ( Schuerger et al., 2003 ). Interestingly, when the more extremotolerant  B. pumilus  SAFR-032 was tested under SMC, no spores were recovered from the aluminum coupon after 30 min exposure, but bacterial growth was observed once coupons were placed in tryptic soy broth (TSB) ( Osman et al., 2008 ). In this study, recovery of fungal conidia exposed in monolayers from aluminum coupons was possible for both ISSFT-021 and IMV 00236 even after 30 min",
